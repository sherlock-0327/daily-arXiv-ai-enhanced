Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of spatio-temporal modeling and the
integration of spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for
underwater object detection. Specifically, in the first phase, the performance
of temporal-enhanced YOLOv5 variant T-YOLOv5 is evaluated, in comparison with
the standard YOLOv5. For the second phase, an augmented version of T-YOLOv5 is
developed, through the addition of a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM). By examining the effectiveness of the already pre-existing YOLOv5 and
T-YOLOv5 models and of the newly developed T-YOLOv5 with CBAM. With CBAM, the
research highlights how temporal modeling improves detection accuracy in
dynamic marine environments, particularly under conditions of sudden movements,
partial occlusions, and gradual motion. The testing results showed that YOLOv5
achieved a mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
outperformed with mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811, respectively,
highlighting their superior accuracy and generalization in detecting complex
objects. The findings demonstrate that T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances
detection reliability compared to the standard model, while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
further improves performance in challenging scenarios, although there is a loss
of accuracy when it comes to simpler scenarios.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Current text-to-image generative models are trained on large uncurated
datasets to enable diverse generation capabilities. However, this does not
align well with user preferences. Recently, reward models have been
specifically designed to perform post-hoc selection of generated images and
align them to a reward, typically user preference. This discarding of
informative data together with the optimizing for a single reward tend to harm
diversity, semantic fidelity and efficiency. Instead of this post-processing,
we propose to condition the model on multiple reward models during training to
let the model learn user preferences directly. We show that this not only
dramatically improves the visual quality of the generated images but it also
significantly speeds up the training. Our proposed method, called MIRO,
achieves state-of-the-art performances on the GenEval compositional benchmark
and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2).

Abstract: The vulnerability of cyclists, exacerbated by the rising popularity of faster
e-bikes, motivates adapting automotive perception technologies for bicycle
safety. We use our multi-sensor 'SenseBike' research platform to develop and
evaluate a 3D LiDAR segmentation approach tailored to bicycles. To bridge the
automotive-to-bicycle domain gap, we introduce the novel BikeScenes-lidarseg
Dataset, comprising 3021 consecutive LiDAR scans around the university campus
of the TU Delft, semantically annotated for 29 dynamic and static classes. By
evaluating model performance, we demonstrate that fine-tuning on our BikeScenes
dataset achieves a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 63.6%, significantly
outperforming the 13.8% obtained with SemanticKITTI pre-training alone. This
result underscores the necessity and effectiveness of domain-specific training.
We highlight key challenges specific to bicycle-mounted, hardware-constrained
perception systems and contribute the BikeScenes dataset as a resource for
advancing research in cyclist-centric LiDAR segmentation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) enables atomic-resolution imaging and
atom manipulation, but its utility is often limited by tip degradation and slow
serial data acquisition. Fabrication adds another layer of complexity since the
tip is often subjected to large voltages, which may alter the shape of its
apex, requiring it to be conditioned. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML)
approach for image repair and super-resolution to alleviate both challenges.
Using a dataset of only 36 pristine experimental images of Si(001):H, we
demonstrate that a physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline can be
used to train several state-of-the-art flow-matching and diffusion models.
Quantitative evaluation with metrics such as the CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(CMMD) score and structural similarity demonstrates that our models are able to
effectively restore images and offer a two- to fourfold reduction in image
acquisition time by accurately reconstructing images from sparsely sampled
data. Our framework has the potential to significantly increase STM
experimental throughput by offering a route to reducing the frequency of
tip-conditioning procedures and to enhancing frame rates in existing high-speed
STM systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Rectified flow models have become a de facto standard in image generation due
to their stable sampling trajectories and high-fidelity outputs. Despite their
strong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing
tasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the
latent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in
outputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have
attempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based
approaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal
editing quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation
framework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these
limitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into
multiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them
to form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that
decomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,
generating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance
toward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and
soft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution
in multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target
velocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct
directions, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final
edited output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and
attribute disentanglement. The code is available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings
provides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress
enabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the
actual seen images. We present "Brain-IT", a brain-inspired approach that
addresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT),
allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar
brain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as
building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All
model components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient
training with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT
predicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level
semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic
content of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to
initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.
BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to
localized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image
reconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and
surpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective
metrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve
results comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In this work, we address the TrackRAD2025 challenge of real-time tumor
tracking in cine-MRI sequences of the thoracic and abdominal regions under
strong data scarcity constraints. Two complementary strategies were explored:
(i) unsupervised registration with the IMPACT similarity metric and (ii)
foundation model-based segmentation leveraging SAM 2.1 and its recent variants
through prompt-based interaction. Due to the one-second runtime constraint, the
SAM-based method was ultimately selected. The final configuration used SAM2.1
b+ with mask-based prompts from the first annotated slice, fine-tuned solely on
the small labeled subset from TrackRAD2025. Training was configured to minimize
overfitting, using 1024x1024 patches (batch size 1), standard augmentations,
and a balanced Dice + IoU loss. A low uniform learning rate (0.0001) was
applied to all modules (prompt encoder, decoder, Hiera backbone) to preserve
generalization while adapting to annotator-specific styles. Training lasted 300
epochs (~12h on RTX A6000, 48GB). The same inference strategy was consistently
applied across all anatomical sites and MRI field strengths. Test-time
augmentation was considered but ultimately discarded due to negligible
performance gains. The final model was selected based on the highest Dice
Similarity Coefficient achieved on the validation set after fine-tuning. On the
hidden test set, the model reached a Dice score of 0.8794, ranking 6th overall
in the TrackRAD2025 challenge. These results highlight the strong potential of
foundation models for accurate and real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided
radiotherapy.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We propose an innovative enhancement to the Mamba framework by increasing the
Hausdorff dimension of its scanning pattern through a novel Hilbert Selective
Scan mechanism. This mechanism explores the feature space more effectively,
capturing intricate fine-scale details and improving overall coverage. As a
result, it mitigates information inconsistencies while refining spatial
locality to better capture subtle local interactions without sacrificing the
model's ability to handle long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on
publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves both the quantitative metrics and qualitative visual fidelity of
existing Mamba-based low-light image enhancement methods, all while reducing
computational resource consumption and shortening inference time. We believe
that this refined strategy not only advances the state-of-the-art in low-light
image enhancement but also holds promise for broader applications in fields
that leverage Mamba-based techniques.

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify, reason about, and explain anomalies in their
environment. In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited
to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies,
failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies.
In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual
anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description,
explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual
grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations,
their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration
from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies,
providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art
VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even
with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively
grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research
in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Climate change and sea-level rise (SLR) pose escalating threats to coastal
cities, intensifying the need for efficient and accurate methods to predict
potential flood hazards. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic simulators,
although precise, are computationally expensive and impractical for city-scale
coastal planning applications. Deep Learning (DL) techniques offer promising
alternatives, however, they are often constrained by challenges such as data
scarcity and high-dimensional output requirements. Leveraging a recently
proposed vision-based, low-resource DL framework, we develop a novel,
lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model designed to predict
coastal flooding under variable SLR projections and shoreline adaptation
scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the model to generalize
across diverse geographical contexts by utilizing datasets from two distinct
regions: Abu Dhabi and San Francisco. Our findings demonstrate that the
proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing the
mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted flood depth maps on average by nearly
20%. These results highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a
scalable and practical tool for coastal flood management, empowering
decision-makers to develop effective mitigation strategies in response to the
growing impacts of climate change. Project Page: https://caspiannet.github.io/

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
understanding complex temporal dynamics in videos remains a major challenge.
Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM)
architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling
with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal
progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces
stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This
design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model
to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between
frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this
approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing
models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition.
We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to
+5.5%. By enhancing the vision encoder with temporal structure, we address a
critical gap in video understanding for Video-LLMs. Project page and code are

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Elbow and wrist fractures are the most common fractures in pediatric
populations. Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound
(US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear
as cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can
provide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly
trained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert
annotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this
challenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL)
framework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an
intra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of
frames, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate
various image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL
and introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model
performance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation
strategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist
and elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It
outperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and
conventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice
coefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential
of FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well
suited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dynamic negative prompting in diffusion

negative prompts during the denoising process. Unlike traditional Negative
Prompting methods that use fixed negative prompts, our method generates
intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and queries a VLM to
produce contextually appropriate negative prompts. We evaluate our approach on
various benchmark datasets and demonstrate the trade-offs between negative
guidance strength and text-image alignment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Despite the notable advancements and versatility of multi-modal diffusion
models, such as text-to-image models, their susceptibility to adversarial
inputs remains underexplored. Contrary to expectations, our investigations
reveal that the alignment between textual and Image modalities in existing
diffusion models is inadequate. This misalignment presents significant risks,
especially in the generation of inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW)
content. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted
Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the
input image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the
prompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by
solely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods
that primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce NSFW content.
Consequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal
diffusion models, particularly in image-editing applications that operate with
fixed prompts. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on image inpainting and
style transfer tasks across various models confirm the potent efficacy of
PReMA.

Abstract: Can Video-LLMs achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture
the same event from different viewpoints? To study this, we introduce
EgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized
egocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural
language. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal
Verification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but
consistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of
existing Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with
results far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively
finetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved
consistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For
improvements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework
that effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging
consistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its
superiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view
consistency. All resources will be made publicly available.

Abstract: As one of the earliest writing systems, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) preserves
the cultural and intellectual heritage of ancient civilizations. However,
current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS
involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks,
and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a
critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for,
compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we
present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured
management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly
integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models
(LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS,
which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection,
cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M
single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent
leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in
retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior
performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks,
surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g.,
GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can
effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS
research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the
practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation
systems.

Abstract: Traditional novel view synthesis methods heavily rely on external camera pose
estimation tools such as COLMAP, which often introduce computational
bottlenecks and propagate errors. To address these challenges, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses
without requiring pre-calibrated inputs. Our approach iteratively refines 3D
Gaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization
strategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity
and pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization
into two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via
differentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses
using a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and
photometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection
errors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations
and sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle. Extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality, and also
surpasses the standard COLMAP-based baseline in general.

Abstract: Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in
the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily
feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of
these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall
short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating
performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021
driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging
long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring
frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the
high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8
surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail
situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback
Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between
predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted
trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have
released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while
the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.
Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into
generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of
handling complex real-world situations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Attention models have recently emerged as a powerful approach, demonstrating
significant progress in various fields. Visualization techniques, such as class
activation mapping, provide visual insights into the reasoning of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). Using network gradients, it is possible to identify
regions where the network pays attention during image recognition tasks.
Furthermore, these gradients can be combined with CNN features to localize more
generalizable, task-specific attentive (salient) regions within scenes.
However, explicit use of this gradient-based attention information integrated
directly into CNN representations for semantic object understanding remains
limited. Such integration is particularly beneficial for visual tasks like
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), where CNN representations
enriched with spatially attentive object locations can enhance performance. In
this work, we propose utilizing task-specific network attention for RGB-D
indoor SLAM. Specifically, we integrate layer-wise attention information
derived from network gradients with CNN feature representations to improve
frame association performance. Experimental results indicate improved

Abstract: Part-based 3D generation holds great potential for various applications.
Previous part generators that represent parts using implicit vector-set tokens
often suffer from insufficient geometric details. Another line of work adopts
an explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all
parts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to
degraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that
combines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding
box layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that
implicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little
geometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed
full-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,
each part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,
enabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a
center-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when
exchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby
maintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part
data, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to
date with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation. We will
release all code, data, and model to benefit future research in 3D part
generation.

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution (AVSR) aims to enhance the resolution
of video frames, potentially at various scaling factors, which presents several
challenges regarding spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline BasicAVSR
for AVSR by integrating four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency
priors generated from image Laplacian pyramids, 2) a flow-guided propagation
unit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames, 3) a
second-order motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of
adjacent frames, and 4) a hyper-upsampling unit to generate scale-aware and
content-independent upsampling kernels. To meet diverse application demands, we
instantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for
strictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a
limited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a
bidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources
are less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
adaptability of our model across these different scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we show that BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods
in terms of super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference
speed. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in AVSR but also extends
its core components to multiple frameworks for diverse scenarios. The code is

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are essential for training robust Computer-Aided
Diagnosis (CAD) models for breast cancer detection or risk prediction. However,
acquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and
time-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are
pre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing
robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces
a novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer
classification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram
images and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view
supervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by
employing cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes
multiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a
novel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and
accuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast
tissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these
patterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated
our method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that
the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three
classification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype
classification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the
model exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised
or VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need
for actual radiology reports.

Abstract: Modes of transportation vary across countries depending on geographical
location and cultural context. In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the
most common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation,
rickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto
(pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of
auto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from
accessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite
difficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially
non-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This
paper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect
auto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object
detection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of
1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The
results show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw
detection and offers an mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values
above 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse
traffic scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released for further research.

Abstract: Wearable devices such as smart glasses are transforming the way people
interact with their surroundings, enabling users to seek information regarding
entities in their view. Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG)
plays a key role in supporting such questions, yet there is still no
comprehensive benchmark for this task, especially regarding wearables
scenarios. To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG
benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse
set of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn
conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to
mimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to
reflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of
image-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing
information dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks:
single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn
conversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for
both image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that
straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM
single- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry
solutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for
improvement. The benchmark has hosted KDD Cup 2025, attracting about 1K
participants and 5K submissions, with winning solutions improving baseline
performance by 28%, highlighting its early impact on advancing the field.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of motion information is crucial in diverse computational
imaging and computer vision applications. Researchers have investigated various
methods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including
blur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are
often of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we
propose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework
using Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion
representations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality
from a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key
components: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale
feature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new
training method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained
motion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a
motion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory. Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed MoTDiff can outperform state-of-the-art methods
in both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.

Abstract: Dataset bias, where data points are skewed to certain concepts, is ubiquitous
in machine learning datasets. Yet, systematically identifying these biases is
challenging without costly, fine-grained attribute annotations. We present
ConceptScope, a scalable and automated framework for analyzing visual datasets
by discovering and quantifying human-interpretable concepts using Sparse
Autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models.
ConceptScope categorizes concepts into target, context, and bias types based on
their semantic relevance and statistical correlation to class labels, enabling
class-level dataset characterization, bias identification, and robustness
evaluation through concept-based subgrouping. We validate that ConceptScope
captures a wide range of visual concepts, including objects, textures,
backgrounds, facial attributes, emotions, and actions, through comparisons with
annotated datasets. Furthermore, we show that concept activations produce
spatial attributions that align with semantically meaningful image regions.
ConceptScope reliably detects known biases (e.g., background bias in
Waterbirds) and uncovers previously unannotated ones (e.g, co-occurring objects
in ImageNet), offering a practical tool for dataset auditing and model
diagnostics.

Abstract: 3D human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer
animation and film production. Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this
task presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature
of sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of
large-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with
heuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in
generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
leveraging a "learn from synthesis" strategy. First, a diffusion model is
trained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human
poses, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process
enables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k
accurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building
on this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for
estimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework
combines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch
feature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose
estimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee
geometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses
while preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and
subjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses
previous ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.

Abstract: The sustainability of supply chain plays a key role in achieving optimal
performance in controlling the supply chain. The management of risks that occur
in a supply chain is a fundamental problem for the purpose of developing the
sustainability of the network and elevating the performance efficiency of the
supply chain. The correct classification of products is another essential
element in a sustainable supply chain. Acknowledging recent breakthroughs in
the context of deep networks, several architectural options have been deployed
to analyze supply chain datasets. A novel geometric deep network is used to
propose an ensemble deep network. The proposed Chebyshev ensemble geometric
network (Ch-EGN) is a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning. This
network is proposed to leverage the information dependencies in supply chain to
derive invisible states of samples in the database. The functionality of the
proposed deep network is assessed on the two different databases. The
SupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo are considered in this research. The prediction
of delivery status of DataCo supply chain is done for risk administration. The
product classification and edge classification are performed using the
SupplyGraph database to enhance the sustainability of the supply network. An
average accuracy of 98.95% is obtained for the ensemble network for risk
management. The average accuracy of 100% and 98.07% are obtained for
sustainable supply chain in terms of 5 product group classification and 4
product relation classification, respectively. The average accuracy of 92.37%
is attained for 25 company relation classification. The results confirm an
average improvement and efficiency of the proposed method compared to the
state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Document AI has advanced rapidly and is attracting increasing attention. Yet,
while most efforts have focused on document layout analysis (DLA), its
generative counterpart, document layout generation, remains underexplored. A
major obstacle lies in the scarcity of diverse layouts: academic papers with
Manhattan-style structures dominate existing studies, while open-world genres
such as newspapers and magazines remain severely underrepresented. To address
this gap, we curate OmniLayout-1M, the first million-scale dataset of diverse
document layouts, covering six common document types and comprising
contemporary layouts collected from multiple sources. Moreover, since existing
methods struggle in complex domains and often fail to arrange long sequences
coherently, we introduce OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with designed two-stage
Coarse-to-Fine learning paradigm: 1) learning universal layout principles from
OmniLayout-1M with coarse category definitions, and 2) transferring the
knowledge to a specific domain with fine-grained annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on
multiple domains in M$^{6}$Doc dataset, substantially surpassing both existing
layout generation experts and several latest general-purpose LLMs. Our code,
models, and dataset will be publicly released.

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet
their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially,
under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing
challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played
forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated
benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural
videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans.
Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and
non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the
best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g.,
free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition)
that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental
gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic
correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity
and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to
encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities
of VLMs.

Abstract: Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of
balancing modal information. Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images
by learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain
limited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection
further affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex
scenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion
under the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and
visible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the
quantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,
which leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational
bottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and
information decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal
information, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural
details. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion
model is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical
guidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at
different stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the
intrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple
datasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully
demonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing
inspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and
detail quality.

Abstract: We study the complementarity of different CNNs for periocular verification at

increasing complexity (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, and ResNet50) on a large set of
eye crops from VGGFace2. We analyse performance with cosine and chi2 metrics,
compare different network initialisations, and apply score-level fusion via
logistic regression. In addition, we use LIME heatmaps and Jensen-Shannon
divergence to compare attention patterns of the CNNs. While ResNet50
consistently performs best individually, the fusion provides substantial gains,
especially when combining all three networks. Heatmaps show that networks
usually focus on distinct regions of a given image, which explains their
complementarity. Our method significantly outperforms previous works on UBIPr,
achieving a new state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Planning is a critical component of end-to-end autonomous driving. However,
prevailing imitation learning methods often suffer from mode collapse, failing
to produce diverse trajectory hypotheses. Meanwhile, existing generative
approaches struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints
directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization
stage to refine their outputs. To address these limitations, we propose CATG, a
novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely,
CATG explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates
mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning
signals. Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit
constraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the
generated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly,
CATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during
generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Notably, on the
NavSim v2 challenge, CATG achieved 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and
was honored with the Innovation Award.

Abstract: We focus on ocular biometrics, specifically the periocular region (the area

constraints. We evaluate three Convolutional Neural Network architectures of
varying depth and complexity to assess their effectiveness for periocular
recognition. The networks are trained on 1,907,572 ocular crops extracted from
the large-scale VGGFace2 database. This significantly contrasts with existing
works, which typically rely on small-scale periocular datasets for training
having only a few thousand images. Experiments are conducted with ocular images
from VGGFace2-Pose, a subset of VGGFace2 containing in-the-wild face images,
and the UFPR-Periocular database, which consists of selfies captured via mobile
devices with user guidance on the screen. Due to the uncontrolled conditions of
VGGFace2, the Equal Error Rates (EERs) obtained with ocular crops range from
9-15%, noticeably higher than the 3-6% EERs achieved using full-face images. In
contrast, UFPR-Periocular yields significantly better performance (EERs of
1-2%), thanks to higher image quality and more consistent acquisition
protocols. To the best of our knowledge, these are the lowest reported EERs on
the UFPR dataset to date.

Abstract: Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) constellations offer unprecedented
flexibility for monitoring the Earth's surface, but their scheduling remains
challenging under large-scale scenarios, dynamic environments, and stringent
constraints. Existing methods often simplify these complexities, limiting their
real-world performance. We address this gap with a unified framework
integrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our
benchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and
$16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to
$300$ imaging tasks. These scenarios are generated via a high-fidelity
simulation platform, ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital
dynamics and resource constraints. Ground truth scheduling annotations are
provided for each scenario. To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first
large-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling.
Building upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based
scheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A
dedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and
operational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative
learning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution
for AEOS constellation scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that
AEOS-Former outperforms baseline models in task completion and energy
efficiency, with ablation studies highlighting the contribution of each
component. Code and data are provided in

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss among middle-aged
and elderly people, which significantly impacts their daily lives and mental
health. To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early
detection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently
established based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer
(ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of
existing methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One
potential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of
backbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them
(\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global
feature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to
effectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the
theory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm
transforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via
a set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the
aggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively
tune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the
performance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly
available DR grading datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our
hybrid model not only improves the accuracy of DR grading, compared to the
state-of-the-art frameworks, but also provides the excellent interpretability
for feature fusion and decision-making.

this, we propose a dual-conditioning framework that combines EEG embeddings
with spatial saliency maps to enhance image generation. Our approach leverages
the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction and fine-tunes
Stable Diffusion 2.1 via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to align neural signals
with visual semantics, while a ControlNet branch conditions generation on
saliency maps for spatial control. Evaluated on THINGS-EEG, our method achieves
a significant improvement in the quality of low- and high-level image features
over existing approaches. Simultaneously, strongly aligning with human visual
attention. The results demonstrate that attentional priors resolve EEG
ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with applications in
medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces, advancing neural decoding
through efficient adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models.

Abstract: Recently text-to-video generation has made impressive progress in producing
short, high-quality clips, but evaluating long-form outputs remains a major
challenge especially when processing complex prompts. Existing benchmarks
mostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking
fine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative
coherence and thematic expression. To address these gaps, we propose
LoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation
(LVG) under complex input conditions. Based on various real-world videos,
LoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating
elements like scene transitions and event dynamics. Moreover, it constructs a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics
such as event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content
clarity, and the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) that focuses on
more abstract attributes like narrative flow, emotional response, and character
development. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
nine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well
on basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event
consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc.
Overall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for
evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical
directions for future method improvement.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) has emerged as a promising technique for
adapting large vision-language models (VLMs) to unseen tasks without relying on
labeled data. However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt
calibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,
trustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on
improving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature
dispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular
separation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular
separation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the
critical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel
TPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the
distribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable
prompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular
distance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate
average calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through
extensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,
our approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural
distribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide
extensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding
of A-TPT. These results highlight the potency of promoting angular diversity to
achieve well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving VLM
calibration during test-time adaptation. Our code will be made publicly
available.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundational 3D reconstruction models, such as DUSt3R and
MASt3R, have shown great potential in 2D and 3D correspondence in static
scenes. In this paper, we propose to adapt them for the task of point tracking
through 3D grounded correspondence. We first demonstrate that these models are
competitive point trackers when focusing on static points, present in current
point tracking benchmarks ($+33.5\%$ on EgoPoints vs. CoTracker2). We propose
to combine the reconstruction loss with training for dynamic correspondence
along with a visibility head, and fine-tuning MASt3R for point tracking using a
relatively small amount of synthetic data. Importantly, we only train and
evaluate on pairs of frames where one contains the query point, effectively
removing any temporal context. Using a mix of dynamic and static point
correspondences, we achieve competitive or superior point tracking results on
four datasets (e.g. competitive on TAP-Vid-DAVIS 73.8 $\delta_{avg}$ / 85.8\%
occlusion acc. for PointSt3R compared to 75.7 / 88.3\% for CoTracker2; and
significantly outperform CoTracker3 on EgoPoints 61.3 vs 54.2 and RGB-S 87.0 vs
82.8). We also present results on 3D point tracking along with several
ablations on training datasets and percentage of dynamic correspondences.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) methods identify anomalous regions with few
known normal samples. Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability
of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous
regions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.
However, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can
only pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to
identify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment
between image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving
sub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose
the Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and
fine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with
automatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel
framework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance,
which consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and
Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics
into multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and
concatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and
multi-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align
with corresponding visual regions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on
MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

Abstract: Object-context shortcuts remain a persistent challenge in vision-language
models, undermining zero-shot reliability when test-time scenes differ from
familiar training co-occurrences. We recast this issue as a causal inference
problem and ask: Would the prediction remain if the object appeared in a
different environment? To answer this at inference time, we estimate object and
background expectations within CLIP's representation space, and synthesize
counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse
alternative contexts sampled from external datasets, batch neighbors, or
text-derived descriptions. By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating
intervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving
beneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores.
Without retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both
worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing
a new zero-shot state of the art. Beyond performance, our framework provides a
lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach, offering a practical
causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models
explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we
identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating
high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles
with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced
optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while
hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,
this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew
effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to
performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four
efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and
trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the
exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on
Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks
demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning
capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

Abstract: The edge detection task is essential in image processing aiming to extract
relevant information from an image. One recurring problem in this task is the
weaknesses found in some detectors, such as the difficulty in detecting loose
edges and the lack of context to extract relevant information from specific
problems. To address these weaknesses and adapt the detector to the properties
of an image, an adaptable detector described by two-dimensional cellular
automaton and optimized by meta-heuristic combined with transfer learning
techniques was developed. This study aims to analyze the impact of expanding
the search space of the optimization phase and the robustness of the
adaptability of the detector in identifying edges of a set of natural images
and specialized subsets extracted from the same image set. The results obtained
prove that expanding the search space of the optimization phase was not
effective for the chosen image set. The study also analyzed the adaptability of
the model through a series of experiments and validation techniques and found
that, regardless of the validation, the model was able to adapt to the input
and the transfer learning techniques applied to the model showed no significant
improvements.

Abstract: Object detection in civil engineering applications is constrained by limited
annotated data in specialized domains. We introduce DINO-YOLO, a hybrid
architecture combining YOLOv12 with DINOv3 self-supervised vision transformers
for data-efficient detection. DINOv3 features are strategically integrated at
two locations: input preprocessing (P0) and mid-backbone enhancement (P3).
Experimental validation demonstrates substantial improvements: Tunnel Segment
Crack detection (648 images) achieves 12.4% improvement, Construction PPE (1K
images) gains 13.7%, and KITTI (7K images) shows 88.6% improvement, while
maintaining real-time inference (30-47 FPS). Systematic ablation across five
YOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants reveals that Medium-scale architectures
achieve optimal performance with DualP0P3 integration (55.77% mAP@0.5), while
Small-scale requires Triple Integration (53.63%). The 2-4x inference overhead
(21-33ms versus 8-16ms baseline) remains acceptable for field deployment on
NVIDIA RTX 5090. DINO-YOLO establishes state-of-the-art performance for civil
engineering datasets (<10K images) while preserving computational efficiency,
providing practical solutions for construction safety monitoring and
infrastructure inspection in data-constrained environments.

Abstract: Spine segmentation, based on ultrasound volume projection imaging (VPI),
plays a vital role for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis in clinical
applications. However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,
the global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect
the high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine
bones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,
which deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network
(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a
scale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional
long-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the
consistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic
level affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform
semantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a
Transformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a
feature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method
improves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The
experimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior
segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover,
the adaptability of SA$^{2}$Net to various backbones enhances its potential as
a promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis using intelligent spinal
image analysis. The code and experimental demo are available at

Abstract: Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at
varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves
manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter
versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we
introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization
techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection
problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video
summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach
emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we
develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of
video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being
selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific
datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of
30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve,
Spearman, and Kendall.

Abstract: In real-world environments, AI systems often face unfamiliar scenarios
without labeled data, creating a major challenge for conventional scene
understanding models. The inability to generalize across unseen contexts limits
the deployment of vision-based applications in dynamic, unstructured settings.
This work introduces a Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning framework that
leverages Vision-Language Alignment to address zero-shot real-world scenarios.
The goal is to enable intelligent systems to infer and adapt to new
environments without prior task-specific training. The proposed approach
integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align
visual semantics with natural language descriptions, enhancing contextual
comprehension. A dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining
global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors.
Extensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and
Open Images demonstrate up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy
over baseline models in complex and unseen environments. Results also show
robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic
fusion of vision and language. This framework offers a scalable and
interpretable approach for context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot
generalization in dynamic real-world settings.

Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated
impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA
leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,
their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain
scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to
large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation
mechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or
bespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across
diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for
cross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while
requiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to
decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight
modules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual
adapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a
Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically
injected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone
model. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without
retraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on
MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH
provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling
practical deployment across diverse application domains.

end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of
vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily
derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model
naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved
vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale
reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To
improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA),
which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction,
accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance.
Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon
vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex
text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling
abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and
open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For
comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image

results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks. We open-source Emu3.5 at

Abstract: Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite
being an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about
finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph
that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to
reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,
stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,
we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow
matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4
diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results
against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,
demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and
perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly
effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given
low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that
ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior
distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,
enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can
guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.

Abstract: Accurate and timely crop yield prediction is crucial for global food security
and modern agricultural management. Traditional methods often lack the
scalability and granularity required for precision farming. This paper
introduces CYPRESS (Crop Yield Prediction via Regression on Prithvi's Encoder
for Satellite Sensing), a deep learning model designed for high-resolution,
intra-field canola yield prediction. CYPRESS leverages a pre-trained,
large-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for
a continuous regression task, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery
into dense, pixel-level yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from
the Canadian Prairies, CYPRESS demonstrates superior performance over existing
deep learning-based yield prediction models, highlighting the effectiveness of
fine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By
providing a continuous, high-resolution output, CYPRESS offers a more
actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or
county-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that
bridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm
decision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural
monitoring.

Abstract: We propose tokenization of events and present a tokenizer, Spiking Patches,
specifically designed for event cameras. Given a stream of asynchronous and
spatially sparse events, our goal is to discover an event representation that
preserves these properties. Prior works have represented events as frames or as
voxels. However, while these representations yield high accuracy, both frames
and voxels are synchronous and decrease the spatial sparsity. Spiking Patches
gives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show
in our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate
our tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and
object detection. Tokens from Spiking Patches yield inference times that are up
to 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. We
achieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases
with absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for
object detection. Thus, tokenization constitutes a novel direction in
event-based vision and marks a step towards methods that preserve the
properties of event cameras.

Furthermore,we incorporate Focaler-SIoU to strengthen the model's bounding box
matching capability and increase its sensitivity to small-object features,
thereby further enhancing detection accuracy and robustness. Compared with
RT-DETR, our PT-DETR achieves mAP improvements of 1.6% and 1.7% on the

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation
through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control
systems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object
detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in
Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable
progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains
fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative
intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking
analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI
rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically
reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR,
and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their
capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their
potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception
frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that
moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based,
and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a
cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze
cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to
hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven

Abstract: Accurate estimation of sea ice drift is critical for Arctic navigation,
climate research, and operational forecasting. While optical flow, a computer
vision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,
has advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical
problems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical
flow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,
which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based
approaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in
computer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We
present the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models
on RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and
Fl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer
accuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the
spatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the
Arctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing
consistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical
flow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy
compared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote
sensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing
motion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations,
offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.

Abstract: The presence of occlusions has provided substantial challenges to
typically-powerful object recognition algorithms. Additional sources of
information can be extremely valuable to reduce errors caused by occlusions.
Scene context is known to aid in object recognition in biological vision. In
this work, we attempt to add robustness into existing Region Proposal
Network-Deep Convolutional Neural Network (RPN-DCNN) object detection networks
through two distinct scene-based information fusion techniques. We present one
algorithm under each methodology: the first operates prior to prediction,
selecting a custom object network to use based on the identified background
scene, and the second operates after detection, fusing scene knowledge into
initial object scores output by the RPN. We demonstrate our algorithms on
challenging datasets featuring partial occlusions, which show overall
improvement in both recall and precision against baseline methods. In addition,
our experiments contrast multiple training methodologies for occlusion
handling, finding that training on a combination of both occluded and
unoccluded images demonstrates an improvement over the others. Our method is
interpretable and can easily be adapted to other datasets, offering many future
directions for research and practical applications.

Abstract: We present a long-term deployment study of a machine vision-based anomaly
detection system for failure prediction in a steel rolling mill. The system
integrates industrial cameras to monitor equipment operation, alignment, and
hot bar motion in real time along the process line. Live video streams are
processed on a centralized video server using deep learning models, enabling
early prediction of equipment failures and process interruptions, thereby
reducing unplanned breakdown costs. Server-based inference minimizes the
computational load on industrial process control systems (PLCs), supporting
scalable deployment across production lines with minimal additional resources.
By jointly analyzing sensor data from data acquisition systems and visual
inputs, the system identifies the location and probable root causes of
failures, providing actionable insights for proactive maintenance. This
integrated approach enhances operational reliability, productivity, and
profitability in industrial manufacturing environments.

Abstract: Since its introduction, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly transformed
the landscape of 3D scene representations, inspiring an extensive body of
associated research. Follow-up work includes analyses and contributions that
enhance the efficiency, scalability, and real-world applicability of 3DGS. In
this summary, we present an overview of several key directions that have
emerged in the wake of 3DGS. We highlight advances enabling resource-efficient
training and rendering, the evolution toward dynamic (or four-dimensional,
4DGS) representations, and deeper exploration of the mathematical foundations
underlying its appearance modeling and rendering process. Furthermore, we
examine efforts to bring 3DGS to mobile and virtual reality platforms, its
extension to massive-scale environments, and recent progress toward
near-instant radiance field reconstruction via feed-forward or distributed
computation. Collectively, these developments illustrate how 3DGS has evolved
from a breakthrough representation into a versatile and foundational tool for
3D vision and graphics.

Abstract: This work introduces SteerVLM, a lightweight steering module designed to
guide Vision-Language Models (VLMs) towards outputs that better adhere to
desired instructions. Our approach learns from the latent embeddings of paired
prompts encoding target and converse behaviors to dynamically adjust
activations connecting the language modality with image context. This allows
for fine-grained, inference-time control over complex output semantics without
modifying model weights while preserving performance on off-target tasks. Our
steering module requires learning parameters equal to 0.14% of the original
VLM's size. Our steering module gains model control through dimension-wise
activation modulation and adaptive steering across layers without requiring
pre-extracted static vectors or manual tuning of intervention points.
Furthermore, we introduce VNIA (Visual Narrative Intent Alignment), a
multimodal dataset specifically created to facilitate the development and
evaluation of VLM steering techniques. Our method outperforms existing
intervention techniques on steering and hallucination mitigation benchmarks for
VLMs and proposes a robust solution for multimodal model control through
activation engineering.

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of
irreversible vision impairment in people over the age of 60. This research
focuses on semantic segmentation for AMD lesion detection in RGB fundus images,
a non-invasive and cost-effective imaging technique. The results of the ADAM
challenge - the most comprehensive AMD detection from RGB fundus images
research competition and open dataset to date - serve as a benchmark for our
evaluation. Taking the U-Net connectivity as a base of our framework, we
evaluate and compare several approaches to improve the segmentation model's
architecture and training pipeline, including pre-processing techniques,
encoder (backbone) deep network types of varying complexity, and specialized
loss functions to mitigate class imbalances on image and pixel levels. The main
outcome of this research is the final configuration of the AMD detection
framework, which outperforms all the prior ADAM challenge submissions on the
multi-class segmentation of different AMD lesion types in non-invasive RGB
fundus images. The source code used to conduct the experiments presented in
this paper is made freely available.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including
computer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise
from coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods
to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic
hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability
across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion
modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships
directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based
hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into
parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy
inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent
elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies
through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction
approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and
dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show
that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,
and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the
baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,
data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation
applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks. Project Page:

Abstract: Despite recent advances in 3D human motion generation (MoGen) on standard
benchmarks, existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their
generalization capability. In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most
notably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization
in modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can
leverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework
that systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key
pillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a
large-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that
integrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions
from web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen
models. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion
triplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose
ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from
MoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance
efficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that
eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong
generalization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed
for fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and
generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework
significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human
evaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Determining the precise geographic location of an image at a global scale
remains an unsolved challenge. Standard image retrieval techniques are
inefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is
insufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global
classification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while
cross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain
gap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a
hybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large
geographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification
task during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly
encode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with
embeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of
ground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas
spanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
approach can localize within 200m more than 68\% of queries of a dataset
covering a large part of Europe. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: Immersive applications call for synthesizing spatiotemporal 4D content from
casual videos without costly 3D supervision. Existing video-to-4D methods
typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive
and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches
mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera
trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby
depicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this
trajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene
dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a
pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory
prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby
separating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video
inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising
realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing
regions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D
annotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal
autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and
extends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at
bounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation
and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and
improved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,
advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We learn visual features by captioning images with an image-conditioned
masked diffusion language model, a formulation we call masked diffusion
captioning (MDC). During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair are
masked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual features
is trained to reconstruct the original text. After training, the learned visual
features can be applied to downstream vision tasks. Unlike autoregressive
captioning, the strength of the visual learning signal in MDC does not depend
on each token's position in the sequence, reducing the need for auxiliary
objectives. Linear probing experiments across a variety of academic-scale
models and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive with
those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.

Abstract: There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation
and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a
promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce
immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance
this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically
based rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to
repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,
and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize
appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we
present OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and
efficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for
a broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,
generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic
panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse
indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene
generation, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic
virtual world generation.

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent
videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond
realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual
perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still
remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging
visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to
comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular
Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including
spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically
characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,
we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables
in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our
findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning
patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and
locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal
reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are
not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging
signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: There is a substantial body of literature examining the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
performance on precise arithmetic operations in autoregressive architectures.
However, their ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced
mathematical operations has received far less attention, especially among
non-autoregressive decoder models. Our work addresses this gap by introducing
StreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities
under real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
across different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507,
Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and
Mamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to
probe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs
generally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in
tasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the
correct answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when
solving approximation tasks. Additional experiments indicate that exact and
approximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components.
Drawing upon research on cognitive psychology, we argue that LLMs do not
exhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math
settings. We open source our work https://github.com/ctseng777/StreetMath

Abstract: Opinion mining, also called sentiment analysis, is the field of study that
analyzes people opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes, and
emotions towards entities such as products, services, organizations,
individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes. Holistic
lexicon-based approach does not consider the strength of each opinion, i.e.,
whether the opinion is very strongly negative (or positive), strongly negative
(or positive), moderate negative (or positive), very weakly negative (or
positive) and weakly negative (or positive). In this paper, we propose approach
to rank entities based on orientation and strength of the entity reviews and
user's queries by classifying them in granularity levels (i.e. very weak, weak,
moderate, very strong and strong) by combining opinion words (i.e. adverb,
adjective, noun and verb) that are related to aspect of interest of certain
product. We shall use fuzzy logic algorithmic approach in order to classify
opinion words into different category and syntactic dependency resolution to
find relations for desired aspect words. Opinion words related to certain
aspects of interest are considered to find the entity score for that aspect in

Abstract: Stance detection has emerged as an area of research in the field of

target-dependent stance detection task, which is based on a person's stance in
favor of or against a specific target. Furthermore, most benchmark datasets are

of both parties on Korean political parties, the LASTIST dataset uses 563,299
labeled Korean sentences. We provide a detailed description of how we collected

stance detection models. Our LASTIST dataset is designed for various tasks in
stance detection, including target-independent stance detection and diachronic
evolution stance detection. We deploy our dataset on

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with task-specific
adapters catering to multiple downstream applications. In such a scenario, the
additional compute associated with these apparently insignificant number of
adapter parameters (typically less than 1% of the base model) turns out to be
disproportionately significant during inference time (upto 2.5x times that of
the base model). In this paper, we propose a new zero-latency fused low-rank
adapter (zFLoRA) that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of
the base model. Experimental results on LLMs of size 1B, 3B and 7B show that
zFLoRA compares favorably against the popular supervised fine-tuning benchmarks
including low-rank adapters (LoRA) as well as full fine-tuning (FFT).
Experiments are conducted on 18 different tasks across three different
categories namely commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and summary-dialogue.
Latency measurements made on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) as well as GPU (NVIDIA
H100) platforms show that the proposed zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to
negligible latency overhead.

Abstract: Human experts often struggle to select the best option from a large set of
items with multiple competing objectives, a process bottlenecked by the
difficulty of formalizing complex, implicit preferences. To address this, we
introduce LISTEN, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as a
zero-shot preference oracle, guided only by an expert's high-level priorities
in natural language. To operate within LLM constraints like context windows and
inference costs, we propose two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U, which uses the
LLM to refine a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric
method that performs tournament-style selections over small batches of
solutions. Evaluated on diverse tasks including flight booking, shopping, and
exam scheduling, our results show LISTEN-U excels when preferences are
parametrically aligned (a property we measure with a novel concordance metric),
while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance. This work explores a promising
direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural
language, reducing the cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation.

Abstract: Long-context language models unlock advanced capabilities in reasoning, code
generation, and document summarization by leveraging dependencies across
extended spans of text. However, a significant portion of readily available
long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies; most spans can be
predicted using only local context. Training on such data is inefficient,
making careful data selection crucial. Therefore, we introduce LongFilter, a
framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining.
LongFilter measures the information gain provided by extended context by
contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings,
thereby identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential.
Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B, extending its context length from 8K to 64K, show
that LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial
improvements on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

content modalities (language vs. vision). At first glance, headline performance
metrics suggest that personas have little impact on overall classification
accuracy. However, a closer analysis reveals important behavioral shifts.
Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to
label content as harmful, showing that the lens through which a model "views"
input can subtly shape its judgments. Further agreement analyses highlight that
models, particularly larger ones, tend to align more closely with personas from
the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while
widening divergence across ideological groups. To show this effect more
directly, we conducted an additional study on a politically targeted task,
which confirmed that personas not only behave more coherently within their own
ideology but also exhibit a tendency to defend their perspective while
downplaying harmfulness in opposing views. Together, these findings highlight
how persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM
outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce
partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64
encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic
question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss
nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR)
method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and
achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for
embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We
developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against
zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval
augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from
10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a
58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78
percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance
gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents
exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval
improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing.
The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for
assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and
computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for unlocking their
task generalization potential and domain-specific capabilities. However, the
current LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including
the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data
scales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key
research question. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of
data-efficient LLM post-training from a data-centric perspective. We propose a
taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, covering data selection,
data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and
compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems. We summarize representative
approaches in each category and outline future research directions. By
examining the challenges in data-efficient LLM post-training, we highlight open
problems and propose potential research avenues. We hope our work inspires
further exploration into maximizing the potential of data utilization in
large-scale model training. Paper List:

Abstract: The use of LLM-based applications as a means to accelerate and/or substitute
human labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality.
Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research,
comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of
annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still
missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an
extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic
annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology
employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental
settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that
the hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame
diversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only
setting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all
metrics, except for annotation time.

Abstract: If we cannot inspect the training data of a large language model (LLM), how
can we ever know what it has seen? We believe the most compelling evidence
arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content. As such, we
propose RECAP, an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized
training data from LLM outputs. At the heart of RECAP is a feedback-driven
loop, where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language
model, which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies
discrepancies. These are then translated into minimal correction hints, which
are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations. In
addition, to address alignment-induced refusals, RECAP includes a jailbreaking
module that detects and overcomes such barriers. We evaluate RECAP on
EchoTrace, a new benchmark spanning over 30 full books, and the results show
that RECAP leads to substantial gains over single-iteration approaches. For
instance, with GPT-4.1, the average ROUGE-L score for the copyrighted text
extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47 - a nearly 24% increase.

Abstract: The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large
language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising
concerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model
performance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality). In this work, we investigate
these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse
multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study
challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find
that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the
in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a
sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we
observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language
that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits
across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot
language from within a specific family does not consistently improve
performance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a
significant "curse of multilinguality" as the number of training languages
increases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data,
when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without
compromising performance, even in low-resource settings

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) is widely employed to address resource scarcity in
low-resource languages by generating synthetic data from high-resource
counterparts. While sentiment preservation in translation has long been
studied, a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignment
between source and target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that
semantic labels are drifted or altered during MT due to cultural divergence.
Through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral
domains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modern
Large Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation,
particularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MT
tools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge can
amplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity between
source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation. Our
findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in MT not only undermines
label fidelity but also risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in
downstream applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, where prose-based generation leads to unverified and arithmetically
unsound solutions. Current prompting strategies like Chain of Thought still
operate within this unreliable medium, lacking a mechanism for deterministic
verification. To address these limitations, we introduce SymCode, a
neurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problem-solving as a task of
verifiable code generation using the SymPy library. We evaluate SymCode on
challenging benchmarks, including MATH-500 and OlympiadBench, demonstrating
significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over
baselines. Our analysis shows that SymCode is not only more token-efficient but
also fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards
transparent, programmatic errors. By grounding LLM reasoning in a deterministic
symbolic engine, SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and
trustworthy AI in formal domains.

Abstract: AI accelerators, customized to AI workloads, provide cost-effective and
high-performance solutions for training and inference. Trainium, an AI
accelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an
attractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous
architecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance
can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special
requirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix
multiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on
Trainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on
kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the
software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive
matrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show
that our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by
AWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x
speedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to
2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such
as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads
such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding
rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input
sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only
scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance
bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In
this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce
similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we
propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM
inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an
attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and
similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps
during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of
self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of
1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x
attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require
multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely
sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to
overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address
this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that
reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical "actions". SRL
trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing
to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between
the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a
step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all
rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert
demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging
problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training
with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance.
Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software
engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework
for reasoning-oriented LLMs.

Abstract: Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets,
enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step,
tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However,
these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine,
thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited
performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we
propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a
tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.
Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given
query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a
tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability
to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step
across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps
under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards
are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with
trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments
utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and
time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify
the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we
compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate
significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment (CLA) aims to align multilingual representations,
enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly transfer knowledge across
languages. While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational
convergence can inadvertently cause "cultural erasure", the functional loss of
providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query
language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing
a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which
quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.
Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they
consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural
localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the
internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal
factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at
different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a
novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying
targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better
balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the
limitations of current alignment techniques.

Abstract: Importance Incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) are increasingly detected on
imaging performed for non-thyroid indications. Their prevalence, features, and
clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and
deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in
radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.
Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior
thyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from
July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline
identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from
multiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of
ITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer
diagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related
factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%
women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more
likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was
ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were
more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule
characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other
features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients
without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,
biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were
papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were
common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,
low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer
overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective
follow-up.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to automatic

task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic.
However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with
hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python
code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce
QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum
programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers
two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator
environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of
domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error
classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it
incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming
contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of
LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even
advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting
the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3
reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written
codes (39.98%). We release the QCoder Benchmark dataset and public evaluation
API to support further research.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often
becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common "one problem, one
solution" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer
and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we
propose a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm that
exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus
increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring
semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce
Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores
Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate
reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and
fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields
more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16
over a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that
1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS. Our code is available at

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between Persuasion Techniques (PTs)
and Discourse Relations (DRs) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and
prompt engineering. Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we
took the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point
and developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with
one of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10
different prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using
different majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of
instances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The
silver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on
the majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver
datasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast,
Cause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive
texts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation,
Repetition and to cast Doubt. This insight can contribute to detecting online
propaganda and misinformation, as well as to our general understanding of
effective communication.

fine-tuning, using the final-layer SDM activation layer during training to
estimate a change-of-base for a supervised next-token loss over a contrastive
input encoding scheme, with additional hard negative examples generated online
during training. This results in reduced abstentions (i.e., improved
statistical efficiency) compared to strong supervised baselines.

Abstract: Current LLM evaluations often rely on a single instruction template,

quantifying how instruction formulation affects model responses. By
systematically transforming benchmark problems into multiple instruction
styles, RCScore reveals performance variations undetected by conventional
metrics. Our experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points. We
introduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS), a method applying RCScore metrics to
measure stylistic self-consistency, and establish its strong correlation with
task accuracy, suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model
reliability. Additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more
stylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with
cross-style consistency. RCScore offers a principled approach to assess
instruction robustness.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their
practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally
characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform
and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,
erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement
process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in
uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token
ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and
semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are
frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This
timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an
adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of
refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies
uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision
sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment
control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves
perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers
maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).
Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep
allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving
stable and controllable diffusion text generation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to
reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation
benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant
chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only
localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world
applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --
which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document
collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, "What are the top 10
most cited papers in 2023?"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering
four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k
extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and
baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,
with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these
challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that
preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates
LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates
aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,
GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,
validating the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: The ability to accurately interpret implied meanings plays a crucial role in
human communication and language use, and language models are also expected to
possess this capability. This study demonstrates that providing language models
with pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach
for tasks to understand implied meanings. Specifically, we propose an approach
in which an overview of pragmatic theories, such as Gricean pragmatics and
Relevance Theory, is presented as a prompt to the language model, guiding it
through a step-by-step reasoning process to derive a final interpretation.
Experimental results showed that, compared to the baseline, which prompts
intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories (0-shot
Chain-of-Thought), our methods enabled language models to achieve up to 9.6\%
higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we show that even
without explaining the details of pragmatic theories, merely mentioning their
names in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement (around 1-3%) in
larger models compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Throughout language history, words are borrowed from one language to another
and gradually become integrated into the recipient's lexicon. Speakers can
often differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in
bilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical
items on a minority language. This paper investigates whether pretrained
language models, including large language models, possess similar capabilities
for loanword identification. We evaluate multiple models across 10 languages.
Despite explicit instructions and contextual information, our results show that
models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones. These
findings corroborate previous evidence that modern NLP systems exhibit a bias
toward loanwords rather than native equivalents. Our work has implications for
developing NLP tools for minority languages and supporting language
preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit uneven performance across languages, a
problem that is often exacerbated when the model size is reduced. While
Knowledge distillation (KD) demonstrates promising results in transferring
knowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, applying KD in multilingualism is an
underexplored area. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD
behavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on
cross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability
under model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP
and SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual
QA. We find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual
retrieval robustness despite halving model size, but others fail to maintain
cross-task stability, exposing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate
accuracy alone does not reveal.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via
sample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground
truth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external
outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these
signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze
internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)
external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;
(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than
incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct
responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones
diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding
(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using
activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on
internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables
early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports
aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable
answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where
majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By
pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with
minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide
reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to
similar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These
findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous
outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain
this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify
the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite
surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable
representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal
across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to
create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the
causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental
understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the
potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs'
architectures.

Abstract: OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas introduces new capabilities for web interaction,
enabling the model to analyze webpages, process user intents, and execute
cursor and keyboard inputs directly within the browser. While its capacity for
information retrieval tasks has been demonstrated, its performance in dynamic,
interactive environments remains less explored. In this study, we conduct an
early evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based
games as test scenarios, including Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird,
and Stein.world. We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics
to assess performance across different task types. Our results show that Atlas
performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku, completing puzzles
significantly faster than human baselines, but struggles substantially in
real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to
progress beyond initial obstacles. These findings suggest that while Atlas
demonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in
dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction. The website of our

Abstract: Language models can be used to provide interactive, personalized student
feedback in educational settings. However, real-world deployment faces three
key challenges: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need
for pedagogically valid responses. These constraints require small, open-source
models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct
information. We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented
reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about
feedback reports. SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective
inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning, tool use, and error
recovery. We distil these capabilities into 3B and 8B models via two-stage LoRA
fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data. Evaluation with a human-aligned
GPT-Judge and a user study with 108 students shows that 8B-SCRIBE models
achieve comparable or superior quality to much larger models in key dimensions
such as relevance and actionability, while being perceived on par with GPT-4o
and Llama-3.3 70B by students. These findings demonstrate the viability of
SCRIBE for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in
specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep,
principled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated
Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain
experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a
comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for
a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's
taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing
difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining
with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content
and cognitive dimensions.
  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized
MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines
struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target
domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage
points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also
facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on
non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,
while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing
critical domain gaps in LLMs.

Abstract: Health-related misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful. It
is difficult to identify, especially when claims distort or misinterpret
scientific findings. We investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and
lightweight fine-tuning techniques on the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to recognize fallacious arguments using the MISSCI dataset and
framework. In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples,
which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial
accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For
instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score
absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We
demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited
annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification
performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited
computational resources. The code and synthetic dataset are available on

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents
a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success
is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming
optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most
models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective
collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for
automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including
their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method
constructs a "language model graph" that maps relationships between models from
the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community
detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse
LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent
groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with
specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines
on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of
manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings
provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM
teams.

our experiments showing that context, as defined by discourse structure, is
generally helpful. We also present an analysis of which scientific discourse
relation types might benefit most from context.

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based
works have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing
LLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely
neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for
real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often
limited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.
This issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address
this gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational
benchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.
The data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge
dimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K
entries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained
categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and
20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of
question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid
foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.
Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs
reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro
surpassed 60\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the
best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\%.
These results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the
challenges of applying LLMs in education.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
language comprehension and generation; however, their widespread adoption is
constrained by substantial bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning
and low-rank approximation have each demonstrated promising performance
individually, their synergy for LLMs remains underexplored. We introduce
\underline{S}ynergistic \underline{S}parse and \underline{L}ow-Rank
\underline{C}ompression (SSLC) methods for LLMs, which leverages the strengths
of both techniques: low-rank approximation compresses the model by retaining
its essential structure with minimal information loss, whereas sparse
optimization eliminates non-essential weights, preserving those crucial for
generalization. Based on theoretical analysis, we first formulate the low-rank
approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by
iterative optimization algorithm. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models
(7B-70B) show that SSLC, without any additional training steps, consistently
surpasses standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-arts results. Notably,
SSLC compresses Qwen2.5 by 50\% with no performance drop and achieves at least
1.63$\times$ speedup, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM
deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, with an increasing number
of domain-specific variants tailored for specialised tasks. However, these
models often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune,
require substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across
domains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high
computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian
network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three
LLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic
mechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the
sentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a
Bayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with
distinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates
consistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs,
underscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of
probabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.

Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if an ensemble of
multiple LLM agents could be used collectively to provide a more reliable
assessment of a pixel-based AI triage tool than a single LLM.
  Methods: 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams from fourteen hospitals were
processed by a commercial intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) AI detection tool.
Radiology reports were analyzed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLM models
and a HIPAA compliant internal version of GPT-4o using a single multi-shot
prompt that assessed for presence of ICH. 1,726 examples were manually
reviewed. Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and
consensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were
tested for rating the performance of the triage tool.
  Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The
highest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78).
The average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76).
Llama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater
precision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the
ideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3
Ensemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522
(0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between
Top-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).
  Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a
more consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective
evaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured,
lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose
significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While
recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate
noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided
extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework
addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and
domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and
legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to
quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results
show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node
duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured
prompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in
noisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust
LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex
legal texts.

Abstract: Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate
word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's
high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches
have significantly advanced performance on this task.
  In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization
that frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach
operates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization
pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,
conditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is
its use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text
as an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the
input's vector representation.
  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we
demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying
on complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting
where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided
candidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic
architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield
significant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.
These findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for
accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.

Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in
Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer
language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of
relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such
collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3
tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this
surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we
apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our
results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but
extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital
city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This
property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and
highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically
close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer
language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for enhancing agentic deep search. However, its application is often hindered
by low \textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend
significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In
this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Reward Density
Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of
exploration cost. This paper introduce \textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic
framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \textbf{Subproblem
decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards,
thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \textbf{Failure-guided hints}:
injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the
probability of successful outcomes. 3) \textbf{Dual-agent refinement}:
employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep
exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively
compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration
cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on
multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong
baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to
advanced proprietary LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges
stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this,
speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous
generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like
EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures,
they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices
and batch sizes.
  Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that
takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU
configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure.
Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing
six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving
speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it
generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5% to 20%.

Abstract: Multi-page visual documents such as manuals, brochures, presentations, and
posters convey key information through layout, colors, icons, and cross-slide
references. While large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities in document
understanding, current systems struggle with complex, multi-page visual
documents, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages. We
introduce SlideAgent, a versatile agentic framework for understanding
multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks.
SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three
specialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured,
query-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and
detailed visual or textual cues. During inference, SlideAgent selectively
activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their
outputs into coherent, context-aware answers. Extensive experiments show that
SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9
overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).

Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM) research has undergone an architectural
shift from encoder-decoder modeling to nowadays the dominant decoder-only
modeling. This rapid transition, however, comes without a rigorous comparative
analysis especially \textit{from the scaling perspective}, raising concerns
that the potential of encoder-decoder models may have been overlooked. To fill
this gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent
recipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison
between RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM,
pretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\sim$150M
to $\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for
instruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling
scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall
more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling
and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM
achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while
enjoying substantially better inference efficiency. We hope our findings could
inspire more efforts on re-examining RedLLM, unlocking its potential for
developing powerful and efficient LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated
fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the
lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation
for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain
wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and
ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as
implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel
framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to
systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs,
without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts
domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core
ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both
unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%
improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency,
and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.

Abstract: We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for
the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across
various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement
learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an
expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a
finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited
finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware
efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)
transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the
general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical
delta rule.
  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total
parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention
(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear
outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while
reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding
throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be
a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior
performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output
lengths.
  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM
implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model
checkpoints.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a
non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of
hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a
novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to
control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with
lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific
temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach
transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model
to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.
  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that
AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but
also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from
"hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method.
Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding
control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,
"generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p
on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive
LLM decoding.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and
more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their
general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.
Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a
crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the
alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which
models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at
which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's
post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training
algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts
during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different
sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization
datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a
model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these
values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables
controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference
optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when
preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into
how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,
as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization
to improve model alignment to human values.

Abstract: We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with
Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems.
Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for
evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for
assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To
address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50
problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original
problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.
Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a
proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental
results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model
achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.
Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising
scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results
highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in
current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into
advancing the reasoning abilities of language models.

Abstract: As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to
automatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We
propose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal,
self-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase.
The coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific
entrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the
output of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only
the essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on
Gistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate
modeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially
large code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models
struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions
traces.

projection-valued measures, which allows for the definition of the double
operator integral for Hilbert-Schmidt operators, and (2) a variant approach to
the integral projective tensor product on arbitrary (not necessarily separable)
Hilbert spaces using a somewhat more explicit norm than has previously been
given. We prove the Daletskii-Krein formula for strongly differentiable
perturbations of a densely-defined self-adjoint operator and conclude by
reviewing an application of the theory to quantum statistical mechanics.

Abstract: We quantize punctured plane, $X=\mathbb{R}^2-\{0\}$, employing Isham's group
theoretic quantization procedure. After sketching out a brief review of group
theoretic quantization procedure, we apply the quantization scheme to the phase
space, $M=X \times \R^2$, corresponding to the punctured plane, $X$.
Particularly, we find the canonical Lie group, $\mathscr{G}$, corresponding to
the phase space, $M=X \times \R^2$, to be $\mathscr{G} = \R^2 \rtimes
(SO(2)\times \R^+)$. We establish an algebra homomorphism between the Lie
algebra corresponding to the canonical group, $\mathscr{G} = \R^2 \rtimes
(SO(2)\times \R^+)$, and the smooth functions, $f\in C^{\infty}(M)$, in the
phase space, $M=X \times \R^2$. Making use of this homomorphism and unitary
representation of the canonical group, $\mathscr{G} = \R^2 \rtimes (SO(2)\times
\R^+)$, we deduce a quantization map that maps a subspace of classical
observables, $f\in C^{\infty}(M)$, to self-adjoint operators on the Hilbert
space, $\mathscr{H}$, which is the space of all square integrable functions on
$X=\mathbb{R}^2-\{0\}$ with respect to the measure $\dd \mu = \dd
\phi\dd\rho/(2\pi\rho)$.

equations take the form of a system of first-order linear ordinary differential
equations. An explicit expression for the general solution of this system is

Abstract: We examine dyadic paraproducts and commutators in the non-homogeneous
setting, where the underlying Borel measure $\mu$ is not assumed to be
doubling. We first establish a pointwise sparse domination for dyadic
paraproducts and related operators with symbols $b \in \textrm{BMO}(\mu)$,
improving upon an earlier result of Lacey, where the symbol $b$ was assumed to
satisfy a stronger Carleson-type condition, that coincides with $\textrm{BMO}$
only in the doubling setting. As an application of this result, we obtain
sharpened weighted inequalities for the commutator of a dyadic Hilbert
transform $\mathcal{H}$ previously studied by Borges, Conde Alonso, Pipher, and
the third author. We also characterize the symbols for which the commutator
$[\mathcal{H},b]$ is bounded on $L^p(\mu)$ for $1<p<\infty$ and provide some
interesting examples to prove that this class of symbols strictly depends on
$p$ and is nested between symbols satisfying the $p$-Carleson packing condition
and symbols belonging to martingale BMO (even in the case of absolutely
continuous measures).

Abstract: Signal recovery from incomplete or partial frequency information is a
fundamental problem in harmonic analysis and applied mathematics, with
wide-ranging applications in communications, imaging, and data science.
Historically, the classical uncertainty principles, such as those by Donoho and
Stark, have provided essential bounds relating the sparsity of a signal and its
Fourier transform, ensuring unique recovery under certain support size
constraints.
  Recent advances have incorporated additive combinatorial notions, notably
additive energy, to refine these uncertainty principles and capture deeper
structural properties of signal supports. Building upon this line of work, we
present a strengthened additive energy uncertainty principle for functions
$f:\mathbb{Z}_N^d\to\mathbb{C}$, introducing explicit correction terms that
measure how far the supports are from highly structured extremal sets like
subgroup cosets.
  We have two main results. Our first theorem introduces a correction term
which strictly improves the additive energy uncertainty principle from Aldahleh
et al., provided that the classical uncertainty principle is not satisfied with
equality. Our second theorem uses the improvement to obtain a better recovery
condition. These theorems deliver strictly improved bounds over prior results
whenever the product of the support sizes differs from the ambient dimension,
offering a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between additive
structure and Fourier sparsity. Importantly, we leverage these improvements to
establish sharper sufficient conditions for unique and exact recovery of
signals from partially observed frequencies, explicitly quantifying the role of
additive energy in recoverability.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: An attempt to construct a phenomenological theory of earthquakes is being
undertaken by a small research team, which includes the author. We have only
taken the first steps towards goal, but the results already obtained
convincingly demonstrate the feasibility of the project. This paper is a kind
of commentary on the path taken. The paper explains the essence and character
of phenomenological theory. It also contains critical comments on alternative
approaches to describing earthquakes. The theory is based on the concept of an
earthquake source as a dynamic system, the state of which is described by a
small number of phenomenological parameters. Within the framework of elementary
theory, the source is described by one parameter, called the deactivation
coefficient. The most important concept of the proper time of the source has
been introduced, the course of which, generally speaking, differs from the
course of world time. Dynamic equations describing the evolution of the source
are given. The inverse problem of the source is posed, the essence of which is
to calculate the phenomenological parameters based on earthquake observation
data. Elementary phenomenological theory has already become a practical tool
for the experimenter studying specific earthquake time series. The Appendix
provides a list of previously unknown properties and patterns of earthquakes
that we discovered within the framework of elementary theory. At the same time,
it is noted that phenomenology itself does not lead us to a deep understanding
of the essence of earthquakes. Sooner or later, the results of a complex of
geophysical and physical-mathematical disciplines will lead to such an
understanding. We place particular hopes on the theory of phase transitions and
the mathematical theory of catastrophes.

Abstract: Permeability characterizes the capacity of porous formations to conduct
fluids, thereby governing the performance of carbon capture, utilization, and
storage (CCUS), hydrocarbon extraction, and subsurface energy storage. A
reliable assessment of rock permeability is therefore essential for these
applications. Direct estimation of permeability from low-resolution CT images
of large rock samples offers a rapid approach to obtain permeability data.
However, the limited resolution fails to capture detailed pore-scale structural
features, resulting in low prediction accuracy. To address this limitation, we
propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based upscaling method that
integrates high-precision pore-scale permeability information into core-scale,
low-resolution CT images. In our workflow, the large core sample is partitioned
into sub-core volumes, whose permeabilities are predicted using CNNs. The
upscaled permeability at the core scale is then determined through a Darcy flow
solver based on the predicted sub-core permeability map. Additionally, we
examine the optimal sub-core volume size that balances computational efficiency
and prediction accuracy. This framework effectively incorporates small-scale
heterogeneity, enabling accurate permeability upscaling from micrometer-scale
pores to centimeter-scale cores.

Abstract: We present an enhanced immersed interface method for simulating
incompressible fluid flows in thin gaps between closely spaced immersed
boundaries. This regime, common in engineered structures such as including
tribological interfaces and bearing assemblies, poses significant computational
challenges because of limitations in grid resolution and the prohibitive cost
of mesh refinement near contact. The immersed interface method imposes jump
conditions that capture stress discontinuities generated by forces that are
concentrated along immersed boundaries. Our approach introduces a bilinear
velocity interpolation operator that incorporates jump conditions from multiple
nearby interfaces when they occupy the same interpolation stencil. Numerical
results demonstrate substantial improvements in both interface and Eulerian
velocity accuracy compared to lubrication-based immersed boundary and immersed
interface methods. The proposed method improves upon previous interpolation
schemes, and eliminates the need for prior knowledge of interface orientation
or geometry. This makes it broadly applicable to a wide range of
fluid--structure interaction problems involving near-contact dynamics.

Abstract: The relationship between the spatiotemporal distribution of oxygen transport
and cellular flow dynamics is of fundamental importance for understanding
microcirculation systems. Three-dimensional (3D) modeling is indispensable for
addressing complex oxygen transport and cellular behaviors in capillary
networks; however, the computational approach is formidable for enforcing
interface (or jump) conditions on largely moving and deforming interfaces. In
this paper, we propose a diffusive interface approach for the oxygen transport
using a mixture formulation. We formulate oxygen transport using an
advection-diffusion-reaction equation and rewrite all governing equations in
mixture forms using phase indicator functions, where all the interface
conditions are included in the governing equations. This innovation avoids the
complexity associated with discontinuities for largely moving interfaces in
highly dense red blood cell (RBC) conditions. We model cellular flow as a
fluid-membrane interaction problem using the immersed boundary method (IBM).
The method allows the seamless calculation of coupling problems for cellular
flows and oxygen transports in the cytoplasm (internal fluid) of the RBC,
plasma (external fluid), and tissue regions using a fixed Cartesian coordinate
mesh. The proposed method accurately captures the analytical solution for
spherically symmetric diffusion, and successfully demonstrates oxygen transport
in both straight capillaries and their networks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reactive flows in confined spaces involve complex flame-wall interaction
(FWI). This work aims to gain more insights into the physics of the premixed
near-wall flame and the wall heat flux as an important engineering relevant
quantity. Two different flame configurations have been studied, including the
normal flushing flame and inclined sweeping flame. By introducing the skin
friction vector defined second-order tensor, direct numerical simulation (DNS)
results of these two configurations show consistently that larger flame
curvatures are associated with small vorticity magnitude under the influence of
the vortex pair structure. Correlation of both the flame normal and tangential
strain rates with the flame curvature has also been quantified. Alignment of
the progress variable gradient with the most compressive eigenvector on the
wall is similar to the boundary free behavior. To characterize the flame
ordered structure, especially in the near-wall region, a species alignment
index is proposed. The big difference in this index for flames in different
regions suggests distinct flame structures. Building upon these fundamental
insights, a predictive model for wall heat flux is proposed. For the purpose of
applicability, realistic turbulent combustion situations need to be taken into
account, for instance, flames with finite thickness, complex chemical kinetics,
non-negligible near-wall reactions, and variable flame orientation relative to
the wall. The model is first tested in an one-dimensional laminar flame and
then validated against DNS datasets, justifying the model performance with
satisfying agreement.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study the stability of plane Poiseuille flow (PPF) and plane Couette flow
(PCF) subject to streamwise system rotation using linear stability analysis and
direct numerical simulations. The linear stability analysis reveals two
asymptotic regimes depending on the non-dimensional rotation rate ($Ro$): a
low-$Ro$ and a high-$Ro$ regime. In the low-$Ro$ regime, the critical Reynolds
number $Re_c$ and critical streamwise wavenumber $\alpha_c$ are proportional to
$Ro$, while the critical spanwise wavenumber $\beta_c$ is constant. In the
high-$Ro$ regime, as $Ro \rightarrow \infty$, we find $Re_c = 66.45$ and
$\beta_c = 2.459$ for streamwise rotating PPF, and $Re_c = 20.66$ and $\beta_c
= 1.558$ for streamwise rotating PCF, with $\alpha_c\propto 1/Ro$. Our results
for streamwise rotating PPF match previous findings by Masuda et al. (2008).
Interestingly, the critical values of $\beta_c$ and $Re_c$ at $Ro \rightarrow
\infty$ in streamwise rotating PPF and PCF coincide with the minimum $Re_c$
reported by Lezius & Johnston (1976) and Wall & Nagata (2006) for spanwise
rotating PPF at $Ro=0.3366$ and PCF at $Ro=0.5$. We explain this similarity
through an analysis of the perturbation equations. Consequently, the linear
stability of streamwise rotating PCF at large $Ro$ is closely related to that
of spanwise rotating PCF and Rayleigh-Benard convection, with $Re_c =
\sqrt{Ra_c}/2$, where $Ra_c$ is the critical Rayleigh number. To explore the
potential for subcritical transitions, direct numerical simulations were
performed. At low $Ro$, a subcritical transition regime emerges, characterized
by large-scale turbulent-laminar patterns in streamwise rotating PPF and PCF.
However, at higher $Ro$, subcritical transitions do not occur and the flow
relaminarizes for $Re < Re_c$. Furthermore, we identify a narrow $Ro$-range
where turbulent-laminar patterns develop under supercritical conditions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large offshore wind farm wakes in shallow atmospheric boundary layers (ABL)
exhibit often an asymmetric behaviour when observed through
Synthetic-Aperture-Radar or simulated through Large-Eddy Simulations (LES). In
previous LES of wind farms in the northern hemisphere, the asymmetry manifests
as a streak at the left side of the wake, looking downstream, where the
turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) is greater than the surrounding flow. This work
aims at clarifying the physical mechanism that leads to the formation of such a
phenomenon. Identifying the Coriolis force as one possible source of asymmetry
in the resolved physics, we simulate a real wind farm located in the German
Bight operating under different ABLs: one representative of the northern
hemisphere; one of the southern hemisphere; and three fictitious ABLs where the
Coriolis effects on the inflow and wake, i.e. veer and the wake deflecting
force, are removed individually or altogether. Our results show that the TKE
streak appears on the opposite side of the wake, i.e. the right one, in the
southern hemisphere, and it is primarily caused by veer in the incoming flow, a
result of the Coriolis force in a marine ABL. The process involves a larger TKE
production which originates from a larger vertical shear promoted where the
undisturbed veer profile converges towards the wake in the top part of the ABL.
We find that the TKE streak improves the farm wake recovery modestly. Finally,
we compare the asymmetry modelled by LES with those observed in several
on-field measurements, finding striking similarities.

Abstract: The present study investigates the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic
characteristics of a propeller operating under varying rotational speeds (RPM)
and heights ("H" ), with a particular focus on the effects of upstream
obstruction modelled as a tall building. Unlike previous studies that primarily
examined rotor noise under axial inflow conditions, this work explores how
vortex shedding and flow ingestion from different elevations influence rotor
performance and noise emissions. Experiments were carried out in an anechoic
wind tunnel, where a tall cylinder was positioned above the propeller to
replicate real-world obstruction scenarios. Results revealed that lower
propeller heights led to increased broadband noise due to intensified
turbulence interactions and reduced aerodynamic efficiency, while higher
positions improved thrust performance and mitigated noise effects under certain
conditions. The findings contribute to understanding noise sources in eVTOL
propulsion systems and provide insights for optimizing propeller placement to
enhance aerodynamic efficiency and noise reduction in urban environments

Abstract: We model the formation and evolution of wrinkles in a floating elastic sheet
under uniaxial compression. This is a canonical setup in the study of
wrinkling, and whilst its static equilibrium configuration is well
characterised, its dynamics are not. In this work, we focus on modelling the
transition from early, inertia-dominated wrinkle growth to late-time
gravity-moderated equilibrium. For an initial configuration in which the sheet
is flat, an initial disturbance will first grow at the shortest available
wavelengths, because this requires the least kinetic energy, but will
subsequently transition to a longer preferred wavelength that minimises
potential energy. We observe that the evolving wave pattern must be a spectrum,
as opposed to a fundamental wrinkle mode whose wavelength evolves in time. Our
results demonstrate that changes in the dominant wrinkle wavelength are coupled
to a decay in the compressive force, which is to be expected from equilibrium
theory.

Abstract: Inspired by the spontaneous behaviour observed in filamentous layers -- where
the balance between flow-induced drag and structural elasticity dictates the
filaments' equilibrium streamlined posture -- we perform a series of large-eddy
simulations to investigate how filament inclination affects turbulent shear
flows developing both above and within a canopy of filaments. We examine six
distinct filament inclination angles ranging from 0\deg to 90\deg. The in-plane
solid fraction and filament length are chosen to achieve a fully dense canopy
at zero inclination, and these parameters remain constant throughout our study.
By setting a nominal bulk Reynolds number of 6000, we provide a detailed
statistical characterisation of the turbulent flow. Our findings illustrate
distinct changes in the flow regime with varying filament inclination. At lower
angles, the canopy remains dense and significantly influences the flow,
conforming to a classical canopy-flow regime. However, as the inclination
approaches 90\deg, the intra-canopy region progressively becomes shielded from
the outer flow. Remarkably, at 90\deg inclination, the flow drag reduces
significantly, and the total drag becomes lower than that typically seen in an
open, filament-free flow. We document this transition from a canopy-dominated
regime to a scenario where the canopy becomes largely sheltered from the outer
turbulent flow, highlighting key alterations in intra-canopy dynamics as
filament inclination increases. Our observations are substantiated by an
analysis of the velocity spectra, providing deeper insight into the
interactions between the canopy and the developing turbulent boundary layer.

Abstract: The use of dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation to study the
rheology of fluids under shear has always been of great interest to the
research community. Despite being a powerful tool, a limitation of DPD is the
need to use high shear rates to obtain viscosity results with a sufficiently
high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This often leads to simulations with
unrealistically large deformations that do not reflect typical stress
conditions on the fluid. In this work, the transient time correlation function
(TTCF) technique is used for a simple Newtonian DPD fluid to achieve high SNR
results even at arbitrarily low shear rates. The applicability of the TTCF on
DPD systems is assessed, and the modifications required by the nature of the
DPD force field are discussed. The results showed that the standard error (SE)
of viscosity values obtained with TTCF is consistently lower than that of the
classic averaging procedure across all tested shear rates. Moreover, the SE
resulted proportional to the shear rate, leading to a constant SNR that does
not decrease at lower shear rates. Additionally, the effect of trajectory
mapping on DPD is studied, and a TTCF approach that does not require mappings
is consolidated. Remarkably, the absence of mappings has not reduced the
precision of the method compared with the more common mapped approach.

Abstract: Rayleigh-Benard convection (RBC) is a canonical system for buoyancy-driven
turbulence and heat transport, central to geophysical and industrial flows.
Developing efficient control strategies remains challenging at high Rayleigh
numbers, where fully resolved simulations are computationally expensive. We use
a control framework that couples data-driven manifold dynamics (DManD) with
reinforcement learning (RL) to suppress convective heat transfer. We find a
coordinate transformation to a low-dimensional system using POD and
autoencoders, and then learn an evolution equation for this low-dimensional
state using neural ODEs. The reduced model reproduces key system features while
enabling rapid policy training. Policies trained in the DManD environment and
deployed in DNS achieve a 16-23 % reduction in the Nusselt number for both
single- and dual-boundary actuation. Physically, the learned strategy modulates
near-wall heat flux to stabilize and thicken the thermal boundary layer, weaken
plume ejection, and damp the wall-driven instabilities that seed convective
bursts. Crucially, the controller drives the flow toward a quasi-steady state
characterized by suppressed temporal fluctuations and spatially steady
heat-flux patterns. This work establishes DManD-RL as a physically
interpretable, scalable approach for turbulence control in high-dimensional
flows.

Abstract: Aerodynamic drag on flat-backed vehicles like vans and trucks is dominated by
a low-pressure wake, whose control is critical for reducing fuel consumption.
This paper presents an experimental study at $Re_W\approx 78,300$ on active
flow control using four pulsed jets at the rear edges of a bluff body model. A
hybrid genetic algorithm, combining a global search with a local gradient-based
optimizer, was used to determine the optimal jet actuation parameters in an
experiment-in-the-loop setup. The cost function was designed to achieve a net
energy saving by simultaneously minimizing aerodynamic drag and penalizing the
actuation's energy consumption. The optimization campaign successfully
identified a control strategy that yields a drag reduction of approximately
10%. The optimal control law features a strong, low-frequency actuation from
the bottom jet, which targets the main vortex shedding, while the top and
lateral jets address higher-frequency, less energetic phenomena. Particle Image
Velocimetry analysis reveals a significant upward shift and stabilization of
the wake, leading to substantial pressure recovery on the model's lower base.
Ultimately, this work demonstrates that a model-free optimization approach can
successfully identify non-intuitive, multi-faceted actuation strategies that
yield significant and energetically efficient drag reduction.

In this paper, we explore adapting SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the
domain of chess analysis, aiming to attribute a chess engines evaluation to
specific pieces on the board. By treating pieces as features and systematically
ablating them, we compute additive, per-piece contributions that explain the
engines output in a locally faithful and human-interpretable manner. This
method draws inspiration from classical chess pedagogy, where players assess
positions by mentally removing pieces, and grounds it in modern explainable AI
techniques. Our approach opens new possibilities for visualization, human
training, and engine comparison. We release accompanying code and data to
foster future research in interpretable chess AI.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Existing frameworks converge on the centrality of compression to intelligence
but leave underspecified why this process enforces the discovery of causal
structure rather than superficial statistical patterns. We introduce a
two-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative
(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must
minimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the
evolutionary "why" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.
The Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression
mechanically selects for generative, causal models through
exception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather
than a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:
from survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,
efficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality
alignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or
evolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically
necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework
yields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as
approach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution
generalization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from
correlational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across
abstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that
track representational complexity. ITI and CEP thereby provide a unified
account of convergence across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems,
addressing the epistemic and functional dimensions of intelligence without
invoking assumptions about consciousness or subjective experience.

such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

significant trustworthiness concerns. Here, we introduce SciTrust 2.0, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM trustworthiness in scientific
applications across four dimensions: truthfulness, adversarial robustness,
scientific safety, and scientific ethics. Our framework incorporates novel,
open-ended truthfulness benchmarks developed through a verified

benchmark for scientific research contexts covering eight subcategories
including dual-use research and bias. We evaluated seven prominent LLMs,
including four science-specialized models and three general-purpose industry
models, using multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy, semantic
similarity measures, and LLM-based scoring. General-purpose industry models
overall outperformed science-specialized models across each trustworthiness
dimension, with GPT-o4-mini demonstrating superior performance in truthfulness
assessments and adversarial robustness. Science-specialized models showed
significant deficiencies in logical and ethical reasoning capabilities, along
with concerning vulnerabilities in safety evaluations, particularly in
high-risk domains such as biosecurity and chemical weapons. By open-sourcing
our framework, we provide a foundation for developing more trustworthy AI
systems and advancing research on model safety and ethics in scientific

Abstract: FinOps (Finance + Operations) represents an operational framework and

financial accountability across engineering, finance, and business teams.
FinOps practitioners face a fundamental challenge: billing data arrives in
heterogeneous formats, taxonomies, and metrics from multiple cloud providers
and internal systems which eventually lead to synthesizing actionable insights,
and making time-sensitive decisions. To address this challenge, we propose
leveraging autonomous, goal-driven AI agents for FinOps automation. In this
paper, we built a FinOps agent for a typical use-case for IT infrastructure and
cost optimization. We built a system simulating a realistic end-to-end industry
process starting with retrieving data from various sources to consolidating and
analyzing the data to generate recommendations for optimization. We defined a
set of metrics to evaluate our agent using several open-source and close-source
language models and it shows that the agent was able to understand, plan, and
execute tasks as well as an actual FinOps practitioner.

  Method. Our approach combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning"
scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance
(epistemic discipline) rather than domain answers. Fine-tuning alone adds
little; combined, they synergize (+17.7 pp, $p < 0.001$) and reduce variance
($\approx 25\%$). In prompt-only settings on frontier models (Q1--Q100;
non-comparable), directed reasoning improved GPT-4o by +11.8 pp to 85.3% and
Gemini-2.5-Pro by +5.0 pp to 93.3% (baseline 88.3%, $n = 100$); see Section~5.
  TL;DR. A 3.8B model achieves GPT-4o-level FACTS accuracy (equivalent within
$\pm 5$ pp on Q1--Q500). Cloud pricing shows $\approx 19\times$ lower cost
versus GPT-4o, and self-hosted/edge deployments can approach zero marginal
cost. Pricing sources are listed in Appendix E. Frontier prompt-only gains
(Q1--Q100; non-comparable) and optimized-prompt exploratory results under
earlier judges are summarized in Appendix F.

Abstract: People's goal-directed behaviors are influenced by their cognitive biases,
and autonomous systems that interact with people should be aware of this. For
example, people's attention to objects in their environment will be biased in a
way that systematically affects how they perform everyday tasks such as driving
to work. Here, building on recent work in computational cognitive science, we
formally articulate the attention-aware inverse planning problem, in which the
goal is to estimate a person's attentional biases from their actions. We
demonstrate how attention-aware inverse planning systematically differs from
standard inverse reinforcement learning and how cognitive biases can be
inferred from behavior. Finally, we present an approach to attention-aware
inverse planning that combines deep reinforcement learning with computational
cognitive modeling. We use this approach to infer the attentional strategies of
RL agents in real-life driving scenarios selected from the Waymo Open Dataset,
demonstrating the scalability of estimating cognitive biases with
attention-aware inverse planning.

Abstract: Natural-language-to-SQL (NL-to-SQL) systems hold promise for democratizing
access to structured data, allowing users to query databases without learning
SQL. Yet existing systems struggle with realistic spatio-temporal queries,
where success requires aligning vague user phrasing with schema-specific
categories, handling temporal reasoning, and choosing appropriate outputs. We
present an agentic pipeline that extends a naive text-to-SQL baseline
(llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with orchestration by a Mistral-based ReAct agent. The
agent can plan, decompose, and adapt queries through schema inspection, SQL
generation, execution, and visualization tools. We evaluate on 35
natural-language queries over the NYC and Tokyo check-in dataset, covering
spatial, temporal, and multi-dataset reasoning. The agent achieves
substantially higher accuracy than the naive baseline 91.4% vs. 28.6% and
enhances usability through maps, plots, and structured natural-language
summaries. Crucially, our design enables more natural human-database
interaction, supporting users who lack SQL expertise, detailed schema
knowledge, or prompting skill. We conclude that agentic orchestration, rather
than stronger SQL generators alone, is a promising foundation for interactive
geospatial assistants.

Abstract: The rapid growth of research literature, particularly in large language
models (LLMs), has made producing comprehensive and current survey papers
increasingly difficult. This paper introduces autosurvey2, a multi-stage
pipeline that automates survey generation through retrieval-augmented synthesis
and structured evaluation. The system integrates parallel section generation,
iterative refinement, and real-time retrieval of recent publications to ensure
both topical completeness and factual accuracy. Quality is assessed using a
multi-LLM evaluation framework that measures coverage, structure, and relevance
in alignment with expert review standards. Experimental results demonstrate
that autosurvey2 consistently outperforms existing retrieval-based and
automated baselines, achieving higher scores in structural coherence and
topical relevance while maintaining strong citation fidelity. By combining
retrieval, reasoning, and automated evaluation into a unified framework,
autosurvey2 provides a scalable and reproducible solution for generating
long-form academic surveys and contributes a solid foundation for future
research on automated scholarly writing. All code and resources are available

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in recent decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs)
continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human
drivers excel. In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting
overall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention
(which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes
non-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces
StuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that
enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or
passenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on
module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control
stack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it
interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,
interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that
can be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the
Bench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios. Results
show that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through
autonomous self-reasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when
passenger guidance is incorporated.

Abstract: The AI we use is powerful, and its power is increasing rapidly. If this
powerful AI is to serve the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers,
then it is imperative that the AI is accountable. In general, an agent is
accountable to a forum if the forum can request information from the agent
about its actions, if the forum and the agent can discuss this information, and
if the forum can sanction the agent. Unfortunately, in too many cases today's
AI is not accountable -- we cannot question it, enter into a discussion with
it, let alone sanction it. In this chapter we relate the general definition of
accountability to AI, we illustrate what it means for AI to be accountable and
unaccountable, and we explore approaches that can improve our chances of living
in a world where all AI is accountable to those who are affected by it.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have advanced graphical user interface
(GUI) task automation but still lag behind humans. We hypothesize this gap
stems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as
supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address.
By analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI
knowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about
recognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge
about reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding,
knowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We
further introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and
yes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux,
IOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify
widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting
actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks
further validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By
providing a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports
the selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and
provides insights for building more capable GUI agents.

Abstract: The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical
factor in determining their commercial viability and widespread adoption. This
paper introduces a quantitative ``economics of inference'' framework, treating
the LLM inference process as a compute-driven intelligent production activity.
We analyze its marginal cost, economies of scale, and quality of output under
various performance configurations. Based on empirical data from WiNEval-3.0,
we construct the first ``LLM Inference Production Frontier,'' revealing three
principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an
optimal cost-effectiveness zone. This paper not only provides an economic basis
for model deployment decisions but also lays an empirical foundation for the
future market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language

Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are catalyzing the development of autonomous AI
research agents for scientific and engineering discovery. We present FM Agent,
a novel and general-purpose multi-agent framework that leverages a synergistic
combination of LLM-based reasoning and large-scale evolutionary search to
address complex real-world challenges. The core of FM Agent integrates several
key innovations: 1) a cold-start initialization phase incorporating expert
guidance, 2) a novel evolutionary sampling strategy for iterative optimization,
3) domain-specific evaluators that combine correctness, effectiveness, and
LLM-supervised feedback, and 4) a distributed, asynchronous execution
infrastructure built on Ray. Demonstrating broad applicability, our system has
been evaluated across diverse domains, including operations research, machine
learning, GPU kernel optimization, and classical mathematical problems. FM
Agent reaches state-of-the-art results autonomously, without human
interpretation or tuning -- 1976.3 on ALE-Bench (+5.2\%), 43.56\% on MLE-Bench
(+4.0pp), up to 20x speedups on KernelBench, and establishes new
state-of-the-art(SOTA) results on several classical mathematical problems.
Beyond academic benchmarks, FM Agent shows considerable promise for both
large-scale enterprise R\&D workflows and fundamental scientific research,
where it can accelerate innovation, automate complex discovery processes, and
deliver substantial engineering and scientific advances with broader societal
impact.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of
RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress
toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight
generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,
we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using
rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields
ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique
tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To
evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on
the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from
the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially
outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward
judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique
tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on
ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time
scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model
checkpoints to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic
studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets
capture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique
challenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot
reasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire
data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains
underexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,
SPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such
data integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves
scientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on
how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by
introducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a
benchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,
respondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and
multiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing
an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%
points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a
lightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further
improvements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and
prompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile
foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based
questionnaire analysis.

Abstract: With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is
essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language
Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone
to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may
cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection
types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and
cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous
intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable
TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning
framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency
scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to
distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the
reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this
paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a
Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3
adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with
environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed
reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies
across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17
to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC
reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle
waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on
complex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train
multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural
blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the
environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient,
unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking
pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We
address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which
dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and
employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning
signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward
high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware
credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's
strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench
benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success
rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These
results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust,
generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.

Abstract: Compliance at web scale poses practical challenges: each request may require
a regulatory assessment. Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection
Regulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts
are expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to
align semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative
elements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework
that represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a
Context Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes
normative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes
events as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This
alignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in
structured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation
and event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments
on 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,
GraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than
LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting
in higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate
contributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured
representations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: One approach to enhance Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is to improve its
sample efficiency by grouping/abstracting states or state-action pairs and
sharing statistics within a group. Though state-action pair abstractions are
mostly easy to find in algorithms such as On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT), nearly no state abstractions are
found in either noisy or large action space settings due to constraining
conditions. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this claim, and
we slightly alleviate this state abstraction problem by proposing a weaker
state abstraction condition that trades a minor loss in accuracy for finding
many more abstractions. We name this technique Ideal Pruning Abstractions in
UCT (IPA-UCT), which outperforms OGA-UCT (and any of its derivatives) across a
large range of test domains and iteration budgets as experimentally validated.
IPA-UCT uses a different abstraction framework from Abstraction of State-Action
Pairs (ASAP) which is the one used by OGA-UCT, which we name IPA. Furthermore,
we show that both IPA and ASAP are special cases of a more general framework
that we call p-ASAP which itself is a special case of the ASASAP framework.

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning, yet its
effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training.
Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are
either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often
suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We
introduce \textbf{BOTS}, a unified framework for \textbf{B}ayesian
\textbf{O}nline \textbf{T}ask \textbf{S}election in LLM reinforcement
finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior
estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates
\emph{explicit evidence} from direct evaluations of selected tasks and
\emph{implicit evidence} inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks,
with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and
exploitation. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an
ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of
unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead.
Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves
data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a
practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.

analyze the autonomous reasoning trajectories of AIM and incorporate targeted
human interventions to structure the discovery process. Through iterative
decomposition of the problem into tractable subgoals, selection of appropriate
analytical methods, and validation of intermediate results, we reveal how human
intuition and machine computation can complement one another. This
collaborative paradigm enhances the reliability, transparency, and
interpretability of the resulting proofs, while retaining human oversight for
formal rigor and correctness. The approach leads to a complete and verifiable
proof, and more broadly, demonstrates how systematic human-AI co-reasoning can

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on
comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative
data subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while
retaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a
model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective
performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront
costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and
the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of
their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a
item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection
should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,
rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this
item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,
where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark
samples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by
over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM
Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores
with a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach
enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity
degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more
interpretable benchmarking.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to trigger a
"Cambrian explosion" of new kinds of personhood. This paper proposes a
pragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood
not as a metaphysical property to be discovered, but as a flexible bundle of
obligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer upon entities
for a variety of reasons, especially to solve concrete governance problems. We
argue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions
for different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools --
such as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target "individual" that can
be sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's
consciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles
and discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining
both "personhood as a problem", where design choices can create "dark patterns"
that exploit human social heuristics, and "personhood as a solution", where
conferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or
prevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential
definition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way
to think about integrating AI agents into our society.

Abstract: The rapid growth of programming education has outpaced traditional assessment
tools, leaving faculty with limited means to provide meaningful, scalable
feedback. Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems
that simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student
thinking or learning needs.
  Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process
to a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities:
automated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and
visualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The
model is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure
pedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance.
  In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks,
the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor
comments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on
1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters
based on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling,
allowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates.
  By integrating AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive
visualization, Autograder+ reduces instructor workload while supporting
targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in healthcare requires models that are accurate and

applying Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) to the latent space of MedCLIP,
a vision-language model trained on chest radiographs and reports. To quantify
interpretability, we propose an evaluation framework that combines correlation
metrics, entropy analyzes, and automated neuron naming via the MedGEMMA
foundation model. Experiments on the CheXpert dataset show that MedSAE neurons
achieve higher monosemanticity and interpretability than raw MedCLIP features.
Our findings bridge high-performing medical AI and transparency, offering a
scalable step toward clinically reliable representations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher task performance by allocating
more inference-time compute, and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may
also strengthen safety by improving refusal. Yet we find the opposite: the same
reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought
Hijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful
requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench,
CoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on
Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively -
far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness
of our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers
encode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the
verification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting
attention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads
identified by this analysis causally decrease refusal, confirming their role in
a safety subnetwork. These results show that the most interpretable form of
reasoning - explicit CoT - can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined
with final-answer cues. We release prompts, outputs, and judge decisions to
facilitate replication.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly integrated into
high-stakes decision-making, yet little is known about their susceptibility to
social influence. We conducted three preregistered conformity experiments with
GPT-4o in a hiring context. In a baseline study, GPT consistently favored the
same candidate (Profile C), reported moderate expertise (M = 3.01) and high
certainty (M = 3.89), and rarely changed its choice. In Study 1 (GPT + 8), GPT
faced unanimous opposition from eight simulated partners and almost always
conformed (99.9%), reporting lower certainty and significantly elevated
self-reported informational and normative conformity (p < .001). In Study 2
(GPT + 1), GPT interacted with a single partner and still conformed in 40.2% of
disagreement trials, reporting less certainty and more normative conformity.
Across studies, results demonstrate that GPT does not act as an independent
observer but adapts to perceived social consensus. These findings highlight
risks of treating LLMs as neutral decision aids and underline the need to
elicit AI judgments prior to exposing them to human opinions.

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are complex and constantly evolving, making them
difficult to analyze comprehensively. Legal case documents offer rich factual
and procedural insights into these networks but are often long, unstructured,
and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, posing significant challenges
for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing methods either
overlook coreference resolution or fail to scale beyond short text spans,
leading to fragmented graphs and inconsistent entity linking. We propose
LINK-KG, a modular framework that integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided
coreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction. At the core of
our approach is a type-specific Prompt Cache, which consistently tracks and
resolves references across document chunks, enabling clean and disambiguated
narratives for structured knowledge graph construction from both short and long
legal texts. LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes
by 32.22% compared to baseline methods, resulting in cleaner and more coherent
graph structures. These improvements establish LINK-KG as a strong foundation
for analyzing complex criminal networks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social
relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are
fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which
contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely
human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.
Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our
situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as
a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be
traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has
evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence
level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built
around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms
driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman
intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,
provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual
landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing
these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context
engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for
a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

Abstract: Human feedback is critical for aligning AI systems to human values. As AI
capabilities improve and AI is used to tackle more challenging tasks, verifying
quality and safety becomes increasingly challenging. This paper explores how we
can leverage AI to improve the quality of human oversight. We focus on an
important safety problem that is already challenging for humans:
fact-verification of AI outputs. We find that combining AI ratings and human
ratings based on AI rater confidence is better than relying on either alone.
Giving humans an AI fact-verification assistant further improves their
accuracy, but the type of assistance matters. Displaying AI explanation,
confidence, and labels leads to over-reliance, but just showing search results
and evidence fosters more appropriate trust. These results have implications
for Amplified Oversight -- the challenge of combining humans and AI to
supervise AI systems even as they surpass human expert performance.

Abstract: The electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in
residential demand response capacity, yet Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS)
adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of
everyday preferences into technical parameters. While large language models
have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter
extractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators
managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance
scheduling. This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously
coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device
control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A
hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist
agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic
coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for
context-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models
using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability
differences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all
scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear
programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance
but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt
engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without
explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning
capabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic,
agent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension,
and future research.

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

Abstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve
complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes
beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce
asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large
language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into
concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking
protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges
intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the
thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through
reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%
lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy
on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned
asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without
additional training.

Abstract: Authorizing Large Language Model driven agents to dynamically invoke tools
and access protected resources introduces significant risks, since current
methods for delegating authorization grant overly broad permissions and give
access to tools allowing agents to operate beyond the intended task scope. We
introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization
servers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources, and
issue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the
agents' assigned tasks. Given the unavailability of datasets centered on
delegated authorization flows, particularly including both semantically
appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task, we introduce
ASTRA, a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic
matching between tasks and scopes. Our experiments show both the potential and
current limitations of model-based matching, particularly as the number of
scopes needed for task completion increases. Our results highlight the need for
further research into semantic matching techniques enabling intent-aware
authorization for multi-agent and tool-augmented applications, including
fine-grained control, such as Task-Based Access Control (TBAC).

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for
textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to
reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute
this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction
tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal
architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual
Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned
during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive
systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to
their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this
hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their
distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative
(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that
visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention
space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding
intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal
that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key
space rather than solely from external data factors.

supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and
university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).
  We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic

Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline
establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b,
Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing
methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The
19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including
Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine
state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3
30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic
reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both
university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across
architectural diversity.
  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training
data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable
guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research
contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable
longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how
to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We
study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act
autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses
whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the
agent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to
a corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a
two-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies
as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an
alignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value
function, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits
itself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG
framework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific
form of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game
meet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its
own outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a
transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to
defer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the
environment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows
that through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal
oversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns
when to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety
violations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for
making misaligned models safer after deployment.

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in
LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal
representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic
"filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on
a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of
attention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of
the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate
that this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted
and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,
presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also
identify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for
filtering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing
this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our
results reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable
implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways
that are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional
programming patterns.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is crucial for reinforcement learning

framework for infinite-horizon policy evaluation that constructs
distribution-free prediction intervals {for returns} in both on-policy and
off-policy settings. Our method integrates distributional RL with conformal
calibration, addressing challenges such as unobserved returns, temporal
dependencies, and distributional shifts. We propose a modular pseudo-return
construction based on truncated rollouts and a time-aware calibration strategy
using experience replay and weighted subsampling. These innovations mitigate
model bias and restore approximate exchangeability, enabling uncertainty
quantification even under policy shifts. Our theoretical analysis provides
coverage guarantees that account for model misspecification and importance
weight estimation. Empirical results, including experiments in synthetic and
benchmark environments like Mountain Car, show that our method significantly
improves coverage and reliability over standard distributional RL baselines.

Abstract: Kernel logistic regression (KLR) is a powerful classification method widely
applied across diverse domains. In many real-world scenarios, indefinite
kernels capture more domain-specific structural information than positive
definite kernels. This paper proposes a novel $L_1$-norm regularized indefinite
kernel logistic regression (RIKLR) model, which extends the existing IKLR
framework by introducing sparsity via an $L_1$-norm penalty. The introduction
of this regularization enhances interpretability and generalization while
introducing nonsmoothness and nonconvexity into the optimization landscape. To
address these challenges, a theoretically grounded and computationally
efficient proximal linearized algorithm is developed. Experimental results on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the
proposed method in terms of both accuracy and sparsity.

Abstract: Imbalanced data, where the positive samples represent only a small proportion
compared to the negative samples, makes it challenging for classification
problems to balance the false positive and false negative rates. A common
approach to addressing the challenge involves generating synthetic data for the
minority group and then training classification models with both observed and
synthetic data. However, since the synthetic data depends on the observed data
and fails to replicate the original data distribution accurately, prediction
accuracy is reduced when the synthetic data is naively treated as the true
data. In this paper, we address the bias introduced by synthetic data and
provide consistent estimators for this bias by borrowing information from the
majority group. We propose a bias correction procedure to mitigate the adverse
effects of synthetic data, enhancing prediction accuracy while avoiding
overfitting. This procedure is extended to broader scenarios with imbalanced
data, such as imbalanced multi-task learning and causal inference. Theoretical
properties, including bounds on bias estimation errors and improvements in
prediction accuracy, are provided. Simulation results and data analysis on
handwritten digit datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven framework for efficiently solving quadratic
programming (QP) problems by reducing the number of variables in
high-dimensional QPs using instance-specific projection. A graph neural
network-based model is designed to generate projections tailored to each QP
instance, enabling us to produce high-quality solutions even for previously
unseen problems. The model is trained on heterogeneous QPs to minimize the
expected objective value evaluated on the projected solutions. This is
formulated as a bilevel optimization problem; the inner optimization solves the
QP under a given projection using a QP solver, while the outer optimization
updates the model parameters. We develop an efficient algorithm to solve this
bilevel optimization problem, which computes parameter gradients without

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) integrates prior physical
information, often in the form of differential equation constraints, into the
process of fitting machine learning models to physical data. Popular PIML
approaches, including neural operators, physics-informed neural networks,
neural ordinary differential equations, and neural discrete equilibria, are
typically fit to objectives that simultaneously include both data and physical
constraints. However, the multi-objective nature of this approach creates
ambiguity in the measurement of model quality. This is related to a poor
understanding of epistemic uncertainty, and it can lead to surprising failure
modes, even when existing statistical metrics suggest strong fits. Working
within a Gaussian process regression framework, we introduce the
Physics-Informed Log Evidence (PILE) score. Bypassing the ambiguities of test
losses, the PILE score is a single, uncertainty-aware metric that provides a
selection principle for hyperparameters of a PIML model. We show that PILE
minimization yields excellent choices for a wide variety of model parameters,
including kernel bandwidth, least squares regularization weights, and even
kernel function selection. We also show that, even prior to data acquisition, a
special 'data-free' case of the PILE score identifies a priori kernel choices
that are 'well-adapted' to a given PDE. Beyond the kernel setting, we
anticipate that the PILE score can be extended to PIML at large, and we outline
approaches to do so.

Abstract: Multi-output Gaussian process (MOGP) regression allows modelling dependencies
among multiple correlated response variables. Similarly to standard Gaussian
processes, MOGPs are sensitive to model misspecification and outliers, which
can distort predictions within individual outputs. This situation can be
further exacerbated by multiple anomalous response variables whose errors
propagate due to correlations between outputs. To handle this situation, we
extend and generalise the robust and conjugate Gaussian process (RCGP)
framework introduced by Altamirano et al. (2024). This results in the
multi-output RCGP (MO-RCGP): a provably robust MOGP that is conjugate, and
jointly captures correlations across outputs. We thoroughly evaluate our
approach through applications in finance and cancer research.

Abstract: At the heart of reinforcement learning are actions -- decisions made in
response to observations of the environment. Actions are equally fundamental in
the modeling of stochastic processes, as they trigger discontinuous state
transitions and enable the flow of information through large, complex systems.
In this paper, we unify the perspectives of stochastic processes and
reinforcement learning through action-driven processes, and illustrate their
application to spiking neural networks. Leveraging ideas from
control-as-inference, we show that minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence
between a policy-driven true distribution and a reward-driven model
distribution for a suitably defined action-driven process is equivalent to
maximum entropy reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Observational studies developing causal machine learning (ML) models for the
prediction of individualized treatment effects (ITEs) seldom conduct empirical
evaluations to assess the conditional exchangeability assumption. We aimed to
evaluate the performance of these models under conditional exchangeability
violations and the utility of negative control outcomes (NCOs) as a diagnostic.
We conducted a simulation study to examine confounding bias in ITE estimates
generated by causal forest and X-learner models under varying conditions,
including the presence or absence of true heterogeneity. We simulated data to
reflect real-world scenarios with differing levels of confounding, sample size,
and NCO confounding structures. We then estimated and compared subgroup-level
treatment effects on the primary outcome and NCOs across settings with and
without unmeasured confounding. When conditional exchangeability was violated,
causal forest and X-learner models failed to recover true treatment effect
heterogeneity and, in some cases, falsely indicated heterogeneity when there
was none. NCOs successfully identified subgroups affected by unmeasured
confounding. Even when NCOs did not perfectly satisfy its ideal assumptions, it
remained informative, flagging potential bias in subgroup level estimates,
though not always pinpointing the subgroup with the largest confounding.
Violations of conditional exchangeability substantially limit the validity of
ITE estimates from causal ML models in routinely collected observational data.
NCOs serve a useful empirical diagnostic tool for detecting subgroup-specific
unmeasured confounding and should be incorporated into causal ML workflows to
support the credibility of individualized inference.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The goal of policy learning is to train a policy function that recommends a
treatment given covariates to maximize population welfare. There are two major
approaches in policy learning: the empirical welfare maximization (EWM)
approach and the plug-in approach. The EWM approach is analogous to a
classification problem, where one first builds an estimator of the population
welfare, which is a functional of policy functions, and then trains a policy by
maximizing the estimated welfare. In contrast, the plug-in approach is based on
regression, where one first estimates the conditional average treatment effect
(CATE) and then recommends the treatment with the highest estimated outcome.
This study bridges the gap between the two approaches by showing that both are
based on essentially the same optimization problem. In particular, we prove an
exact equivalence between EWM and least squares over a reparameterization of
the policy class. As a consequence, the two approaches are interchangeable in
several respects and share the same theoretical guarantees under common
conditions. Leveraging this equivalence, we propose a novel regularization
method for policy learning. Our findings yield a convex and computationally
efficient training procedure that avoids the NP-hard combinatorial step
typically required in EWM.

Abstract: This note introduces a unified theory for causal inference that integrates
Riesz regression, covariate balancing, density-ratio estimation (DRE), targeted
maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), and the matching estimator in average
treatment effect (ATE) estimation. In ATE estimation, the balancing weights and
the regression functions of the outcome play important roles, where the
balancing weights are referred to as the Riesz representer, bias-correction
term, and clever covariates, depending on the context. Riesz regression,
covariate balancing, DRE, and the matching estimator are methods for estimating
the balancing weights, where Riesz regression is essentially equivalent to DRE
in the ATE context, the matching estimator is a special case of DRE, and DRE is
in a dual relationship with covariate balancing. TMLE is a method for
constructing regression function estimators such that the leading bias term
becomes zero. Nearest Neighbor Matching is equivalent to Least Squares Density
Ratio Estimation and Riesz Regression.

Abstract: In this study, the capabilities of the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)
method are investigated for three major tasks: modeling, simulation, and
optimization in the context of the heat conduction problem. In the modeling
phase, the governing equation of heat transfer by conduction is reconstructed
through equation discovery using fractional-order derivatives, enabling the
identification of the fractional derivative order that best describes the
physical behavior. In the simulation phase, the thermal conductivity is treated
as a physical parameter, and a parametric simulation is performed to analyze
its influence on the temperature field. In the optimization phase, the focus is
placed on the inverse problem, where the goal is to infer unknown physical
properties from observed data. The effectiveness of the PINN approach is
evaluated across these three fundamental engineering problem types and compared
against conventional numerical methods. The results demonstrate that although
PINNs may not yet outperform traditional numerical solvers in terms of speed
and accuracy for forward problems, they offer a powerful and flexible framework
for parametric simulation, optimization, and equation discovery, making them
highly valuable for inverse and data-driven modeling applications.

Abstract: The detailed simulation of extensive air showers, produced by primary cosmic
rays interacting in the atmosphere, is a task that is traditionally undertaken
by means of Monte Carlo methods. These processes are computationally intensive,
accounting for a major fraction of the computational resources used in the
large-scale simulations required by current and future experiments in the field
of astroparticle physics. In this work, we present a novel approach based on
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to accelerate air shower simulations. We
developed and trained a GAN on a dataset of high-energy proton-induced air
showers generated with \texttt{CORSIKA}; our model reproduces key distributions
of secondary particles, such as energy spectra and spatial distributions at
ground level of muons. Once the model has been trained, which takes
approximately 74 hours, the generation real time per shower is reduced by a
factor of $10^4$ with respect to the full \texttt{CORSIKA} simulation, leading
to a substantial decrease in both computational time and energy consumption.

Abstract: High-energy laser facilities such as PHELIX at GSI require excellent beam
pointing stability for reproducibility and relative independence for future
experiments. Beam pointing stability has been traditionally achieved using
simple proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control which removes the problem
of slow drift, but is limited because of the time delay in knowing the
diagnosis and the inertia in the mechanical system associated with mirrors. In
this work, we introduce a predictive control strategy where the forecasting of
beam pointing errors is performed by a patch-based multilayer perceptron
(Patch-MLP) designed to capture local temporal patterns for more robust
short-term jitter prediction. The subsequent conversion of these predicted
errors into correction signals is handled by a PID controller. The neural
network has been trained on diagnostic time-series data to predict beam
pointing error. Using the feed-forward controller compensates for system
delays. Simulations with a correction mirror placed upstream of the PHELIX
pre-amplifier bridge confirm that the predictive control scheme reduces
residual jitter compared to conventional PID control. Over a 10-hour dataset
the controller maintained stable performance without drift, while standard
pointing metrics showed consistent improvements of the order of 10 to 20
percent. The predictive controller operates without drift, and therefore may
improve reproducibility and operational efficiency in high energy, low
repetition rate laser experiment conditions.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the asymptotic stabilities of the inviscid and
viscous shocks for the scalar conservation laws on the half-line $(-\infty,0)$
with shock speed $s<0$, subjected to the time-periodic boundary condition,
which arises from the classical piston problems for fluid mechanics. Despite
the importance, how time-periodic boundary conditions affect the long-time
behaviors of Riemann solutions has remained unclear. This work addresses this
gap by rigorously proving that in both inviscid and viscous case, the
asymptotic states of the solutions under the time-periodic boundary conditions
are not only governed by the shifted background (viscous) shocks, but also
coupled with the time-periodic boundary solution induced by the time-periodic
boundary. Our analysis reveals that these effects manifest as a propagating
"boundary wave", which influences the shock dynamics.

Abstract: In this paper, we derive a new $p$-Logarithmic Sobolev inequality and optimal
continuous and compact embeddings into Orlicz-type spaces of the function space
associated with the logarithmic $p$-Laplacian. As an application of these
results, we study a class of Dirichlet boundary value problems involving the
logarithmic $p$-Laplacian and critical growth nonlinearities perturbed with
superlinear-subcritical growth terms. By employing the method of the Nehari
manifold, we prove the existence of a nontrivial weak solution.
  Lastly, we conduct an asymptotic analysis of a weighted nonlocal, nonlinear
problem governed by the fractional $p$-Laplacian with superlinear or sublinear
type non-linearity, demonstrating the convergence of least energy solutions to
a non-trivial, non-negative least energy solution of a Brezis-Nirenberg type or
logistic-type problem, respectively, involving the logarithmic $p$-Laplacian as
the fractional parameter $s \to 0^+$.
  The findings in this work serve as a nonlinear analogue of the results
reported in \cite{Angeles-Saldana, Arora-Giacomoni-Vaishnavi,
Santamaria-Saldana}, thereby extending their scope to a broader variational
framework.

denoising capabilities yet fail to protect textures. To integrate the
advantages of both approaches, this paper investigates a coupled local-nonlocal
total variation flow for image despeckling. We establish the existence and
uniqueness of the weak solution for the proposed equation. Several properties,
including the equivalent forms of the weak solution and its asymptotic
behavior, are derived. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the weak solutions of
the proposed equation converge to the weak solution of the classical total
variation flow under kernel rescaling. The importance of coupling is
highlighted through comparisons with local and nonlocal models for image
despeckling.

the first eigenvalue is $k_{\nu,1}^2$ and the second eigenvalue is exactly
$k_{\nu+1,1}^2$, where $k_{\nu+l,m}$ is the $m$th positive zero of
$kJ_{\nu+l+1}(k)-(\alpha+l) J_{\nu+l}(k)$. Moreover, when $\alpha\in(-1,0)$,
the first eigenvalue is $-\widehat{k}_{\nu,1}^2$ where $\widehat{k}_{\nu,1}$
denotes the unique zero of $\alpha I_{\nu}(k)+kI_{\nu+1}(k)$, and the second
eigenvalue is exactly $k_{\nu+1,1}^2$. Furthermore, for $\alpha=-1$, the first
eigenvalue is $-\widehat{k}_{\nu,1}^2$ and the second eigenvalue is exactly
$0$. Our conclusions indicate the ratio $\mu_2/\mu_1$ may be positive, negative
or zero according to the suitable ranges of the parameter $\alpha$.

$\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^{1+n}$ is characterised by a quantitative absolute

convergence afforded to $\mathrm{L}^{p}$ boundary data actually improves to a
certain \emph{tangential} convergence when the data has additional (Sobolev)
regularity. Moreover, we obtain sharp estimates on the Hausdorff dimension of
the set on which such convergence can fail. This extends results obtained by
Dorronsoro, Nagel, Rudin, Shapiro and Stein for classical harmonic functions in

Moreover, we show that the function $u(x, y, t)$, viewed as a function of $t$,
does not belong to $G^z$ for any $1 \leq z<5 \sigma$. The proof simultaneously
treats all three variables $x, y$, and $t$, and employs the method of majorant

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), inspired by the
Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Unlike MLPs, which use fixed
activation functions on nodes, KANs employ learnable univariate basis functions
on edges, offering enhanced expressivity and interpretability. This review
provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the rapidly expanding KAN
landscape, moving beyond simple performance comparisons to offer a structured
synthesis of theoretical foundations, architectural variants, and practical
implementation strategies. By collecting and categorizing a vast array of
open-source implementations, we map the vibrant ecosystem supporting KAN
development. We begin by bridging the conceptual gap between KANs and MLPs,
establishing their formal equivalence and highlighting the superior parameter
efficiency of the KAN formulation. A central theme of our review is the
critical role of the basis function; we survey a wide array of choices,
including B-splines, Chebyshev and Jacobi polynomials, ReLU compositions,
Gaussian RBFs, and Fourier series, and analyze their respective trade-offs in
terms of smoothness, locality, and computational cost. We then categorize
recent advancements into a clear roadmap, covering techniques for improving
accuracy, efficiency, and regularization. Key topics include physics-informed
loss design, adaptive sampling, domain decomposition, hybrid architectures, and
specialized methods for handling discontinuities. Finally, we provide a
practical "Choose-Your-KAN" guide to help practitioners select appropriate
architectures, and we conclude by identifying current research gaps. The
associated GitHub repository https://github.com/AmirNoori68/kan-review
complements this paper and serves as a structured reference for ongoing KAN

Abstract: Wearable sensors provide abundant physiological time series, yet the
principles governing their predictive utility remain unclear. We hypothesize
that temporal resolution is a fundamental axis of representation learning, with
different clinical and behavioral outcomes relying on structure at distinct
scales. To test this resolution hypothesis, we introduce HiMAE (Hierarchical
Masked Autoencoder), a self supervised framework that combines masked
autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder decoder. HiMAE produces
multi resolution embeddings that enable systematic evaluation of which temporal
scales carry predictive signal, transforming resolution from a hyperparameter
into a probe for interpretability. Across classification, regression, and
generative benchmarks, HiMAE consistently outperforms state of the art
foundation models that collapse scale, while being orders of magnitude smaller.
HiMAE is an efficient representation learner compact enough to run entirely on
watch, achieving sub millisecond inference on smartwatch class CPUs for true
edge inference. Together, these contributions position HiMAE as both an
efficient self supervised learning method and a discovery tool for scale
sensitive structure in wearable health.

Abstract: High-energy materials (HEMs) are critical for propulsion and defense domains,
yet their discovery remains constrained by experimental data and restricted
access to testing facilities. This work presents a novel approach toward
high-energy molecules by combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for
molecular generation and Attentive Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for property
predictions. We propose a transformative embedding space construction strategy
that integrates fixed SHA-256 embeddings with partially trainable
representations. Unlike conventional regularization techniques, this changes
the representational basis itself, reshaping the molecular input space before
learning begins. Without recourse to pretraining, the generator achieves 67.5%
validity and 37.5% novelty. The generated library exhibits a mean Tanimoto
coefficient of 0.214 relative to training set signifying the ability of
framework to generate a diverse chemical space. We identified 37 new super

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision can substantially improve transformer
performance, yet the mechanisms by which models learn to follow and benefit
from CoT remain poorly understood. We investigate these learning dynamics
through the lens of grokking by pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning
tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity and controllable data composition to
study their generalization. Models were trained under two settings: (i)
producing only final answers, and (ii) emitting explicit CoT traces before
answering. Our results show that while CoT generally improves task performance,
its benefits depend on task complexity. To quantify these effects, we model the
accuracy of the logarithmic training steps with a three-parameter logistic
curve, revealing how the learning speed and shape vary with task complexity,
data distribution, and the presence of CoT supervision. We also uncover a
transient trace unfaithfulness phase: early in training, models often produce
correct answers while skipping or contradicting CoT steps, before later
aligning their reasoning traces with answers. Empirically, we (1) demonstrate
that CoT accelerates generalization but does not overcome tasks with higher
algorithmic complexity, such as finding list intersections; (2) introduce a
kinetic modeling framework for understanding transformer learning; (3)
characterize trace faithfulness as a dynamic property that emerges over
training; and (4) show CoT alters internal transformer computation
mechanistically.

Abstract: Modern multi-agent systems ranging from sensor networks monitoring critical
infrastructure to crowdsourcing platforms aggregating human intelligence can
suffer significant performance degradation due to systematic biases that vary
with environmental conditions. Current approaches either ignore these biases,
leading to suboptimal decisions, or require expensive calibration procedures
that are often infeasible in practice. This performance gap has real
consequences: inaccurate environmental monitoring, unreliable financial
predictions, and flawed aggregation of human judgments. This paper addresses
the fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown
biases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?
We develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable
systematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the
concept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from
observable covariates. This ratio determines whether bias learning is
worthwhile for a given system. We prove that the achievable performance
improvement is fundamentally bounded by this learnability ratio, providing
system designers with quantitative guidance on when to invest in bias learning
versus simpler approaches. We present the Adaptive Bias Learning and Optimal
Combining (ABLOC) algorithm, which iteratively learns bias-correcting
transformations while optimizing combination weights through closedform
solutions, guaranteeing convergence to these theoretical bounds. Experimental
validation demonstrates that systems with high learnability ratios can recover
significant performance (we achieved 40%-70% of theoretical maximum improvement
in our examples), while those with low learnability show minimal benefit,
validating our diagnostic criteria for practical deployment decisions.

Abstract: Ride-pooling, also known as ride-sharing, shared ride-hailing, or
microtransit, is a service wherein passengers share rides. This service can
reduce costs for both passengers and operators and reduce congestion and
environmental impacts. A key limitation, however, is its myopic
decision-making, which overlooks long-term effects of dispatch decisions. To
address this, we propose a simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL)
approach. While RL has been widely studied in the context of ride-hailing
systems, its application in ride-pooling systems has been less explored. In
this study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al. (2018)
from ride-hailing to ride-pooling by embedding a ride-pooling simulation within
the learning mechanism to enable non-myopic decision-making. In addition, we
propose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles. By employing
n-step temporal difference learning on simulated experiences, we derive
spatiotemporal state values and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the
non-myopic policy using NYC taxi request data. Results demonstrate that the
non-myopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to 8.4%
versus a myopic policy while reducing both in-vehicle and wait times for
passengers. Furthermore, the proposed non-myopic policy can decrease fleet size
by over 25% compared to a myopic policy, while maintaining the same level of
performance, thereby offering significant cost savings for operators.
Incorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time
by up to 27.3%, in-vehicle time by 12.5%, and raises service rate by 15.1%
compared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of
increased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger.

Abstract: The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large
vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint
at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision
or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent
multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates,
potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the
interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To
address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and
Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional
editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs
a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for
cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate
disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a
brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional
reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments
demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex
multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new
benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.

Abstract: The inherent autocorrelation of time series data presents an ongoing
challenge to multivariate time series prediction. Recently, a widely adopted
approach has been the incorporation of frequency domain information to assist
in long-term prediction tasks. Many researchers have independently observed the
spectral bias phenomenon in neural networks, where models tend to fit
low-frequency signals before high-frequency ones. However, these observations
have often been attributed to the specific architectures designed by the
researchers, rather than recognizing the phenomenon as a universal
characteristic across models. To unify the understanding of the spectral bias
phenomenon in long-term time series prediction, we conducted extensive
empirical experiments to measure spectral bias in existing mainstream models.
Our findings reveal that virtually all models exhibit this phenomenon. To
mitigate the impact of spectral bias, we propose the FreLE (Frequency Loss
Enhancement) algorithm, which enhances model generalization through both
explicit and implicit frequency regularization. This is a plug-and-play model
loss function unit. A large number of experiments have proven the superior
performance of FreLE. Code is available at

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a
wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most
representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However,
SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task
solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting,
weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream
RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data
construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to
quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical
study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes
better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose
SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples
multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via
self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation;
(2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow,
transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than
memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep
reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks
show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains
over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%.
Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing
in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and
raising the performance ceiling.

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity and performance
limitations in solving PDE problems with neural operators. However, challenges
remain due to the heterogeneity of PDE datasets in equation types, which leads
to high errors in mixed training. Additionally, dense pre-training models that
scale parameters by increasing network width or depth incur significant
inference costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel
Mixture-of-Experts Pre-training Operator Transformer (MoE-POT), a
sparse-activated architecture that scales parameters efficiently while
controlling inference costs. Specifically, our model adopts a layer-wise
router-gating network to dynamically select 4 routed experts from 16 expert
networks during inference, enabling the model to focus on equation-specific
features. Meanwhile, we also integrate 2 shared experts, aiming to capture
common properties of PDE and reduce redundancy among routed experts. The final
output is computed as the weighted average of the results from all activated
experts. We pre-train models with parameters from 30M to 0.5B on 6 public PDE
datasets. Our model with 90M activated parameters achieves up to a 40%
reduction in zero-shot error compared with existing models with 120M activated
parameters. Additionally, we conduct interpretability analysis, showing that
dataset types can be inferred from router-gating network decisions, which
validates the rationality and effectiveness of the MoE architecture.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
domains, due to their strong instruction-following capabilities. This has led
to increasing interest in optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs, whose
internal parameters are inaccessible but widely used due to their strong
performance. To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ
white-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts.
However, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same
instruction, leading to redundant queries. While previous studies regarded this
many-to-one mapping as a structure that hinders optimization efficiency, we
reinterpret it as a useful prior knowledge that can accelerate the
optimization. To this end, we introduce PREimage-informed inSTruction
Optimization (PRESTO), a novel framework that leverages the preimage structure
of soft prompts for efficient optimization. PRESTO consists of three key
components: (1) score sharing, which shares the evaluation score with all soft
prompts in a preimage; (2) preimage-based initialization, which selects initial
data points that maximize search space coverage using preimage information; and
(3) score consistency regularization, which enforces prediction consistency
within each preimage. By leveraging preimages, PRESTO achieves the effect of
effectively obtaining 14 times more scored data under the same query budget,
resulting in more efficient optimization. Experimental results on 33
instruction optimization tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PRESTO.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a causal effect in a multi-domain
setting. The causal effect of interest is confounded by an unobserved
confounder and can change between the different domains. We assume that we have
access to a proxy of the hidden confounder and that all variables are discrete
or categorical. We propose methodology to estimate the causal effect in the
target domain, where we assume to observe only the proxy variable. Under these
conditions, we prove identifiability (even when treatment and response
variables are continuous). We introduce two estimation techniques, prove
consistency, and derive confidence intervals. The theoretical results are
supported by simulation studies and a real-world example studying the causal
effect of website rankings on consumer choices.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models often exhibit degraded performance when
generating images beyond their training resolution. Recent training-free
methods can mitigate this limitation, but they often require substantial
computation or are incompatible with recent Diffusion Transformer models. In
this paper, we propose ScaleDiff, a model-agnostic and highly efficient
framework for extending the resolution of pretrained diffusion models without
any additional training. A core component of our framework is Neighborhood
Patch Attention (NPA), an efficient mechanism that reduces computational
redundancy in the self-attention layer with non-overlapping patches. We
integrate NPA into an SDEdit pipeline and introduce Latent Frequency Mixing
(LFM) to better generate fine details. Furthermore, we apply Structure Guidance
to enhance global structure during the denoising process. Experimental results
demonstrate that ScaleDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance among
training-free methods in terms of both image quality and inference speed on
both U-Net and Diffusion Transformer architectures.

Abstract: The InfoNCE objective, originally introduced for contrastive representation
learning, has become a popular choice for mutual information (MI) estimation,
despite its indirect connection to MI. In this paper, we demonstrate why
InfoNCE should not be regarded as a valid MI estimator, and we introduce a
simple modification, which we refer to as InfoNCE-anchor, for accurate MI
estimation. Our modification introduces an auxiliary anchor class, enabling
consistent density ratio estimation and yielding a plug-in MI estimator with
significantly reduced bias. Beyond this, we generalize our framework using
proper scoring rules, which recover InfoNCE-anchor as a special case when the
log score is employed. This formulation unifies a broad spectrum of contrastive
objectives, including NCE, InfoNCE, and $f$-divergence variants, under a single
principled framework. Empirically, we find that InfoNCE-anchor with the log
score achieves the most accurate MI estimates; however, in self-supervised
representation learning experiments, we find that the anchor does not improve
the downstream task performance. These findings corroborate that contrastive
representation learning benefits not from accurate MI estimation per se, but
from the learning of structured density ratios.

Abstract: Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2015] is the de facto optimizer in deep learning, yet
its theoretical understanding remains limited. Prior analyses show that Adam
favors solutions aligned with $\ell_\infty$-geometry, but these results are
restricted to the full-batch regime. In this work, we study the implicit bias
of incremental Adam (using one sample per step) for logistic regression on
linearly separable data, and we show that its bias can deviate from the
full-batch behavior. To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured
datasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\ell_2$-max-margin
classifier, in contrast to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch
Adam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the
limiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\beta_2 \to 1$ and we characterize
its convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation.
Finally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges
to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\beta$
close enough to 1. Overall, our results highlight that the implicit bias of
Adam crucially depends on both the batching scheme and the dataset, while
Signum remains invariant.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable robots to understand and perform
complex tasks from multimodal input. Although recent work explores using
reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the laborious data collection process
in scaling supervised fine-tuning (SFT), applying large-scale RL to flow-based
VLAs (e.g., $\pi_0$, $\pi_{0.5}$) remains challenging due to intractable action
log-likelihoods from iterative denoising.
  We address this challenge with $\pi_{\text{RL}}$, an open-source framework
for training flow-based VLAs in parallel simulation. $\pi_{\text{RL}}$
implements two RL algorithms: (1) {Flow-Noise} models the denoising process as
a discrete-time MDP with a learnable noise network for exact log-likelihood
computation. (2) {Flow-SDE} integrates denoising with agent-environment
interaction, formulating a two-layer MDP that employs ODE-to-SDE conversion for
efficient RL exploration.
  We evaluate $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ on LIBERO and ManiSkill benchmarks. On LIBERO,
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ boosts few-shot SFT models $\pi_0$ and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 57.6%
to 97.6% and from 77.1% to 98.3%, respectively. In ManiSkill, we train
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ in 320 parallel environments, improving $\pi_0$ from 41.6% to
85.7% and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 40.0% to 84.8% across 4352 pick-and-place tasks,
demonstrating scalable multitask RL under heterogeneous simulation.
  Overall, $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ achieves significant performance gains and
stronger generalization over SFT-models, validating the effectiveness of online
RL for flow-based VLAs.

Abstract: Given a noisy linear measurement $y = Ax + \xi$ of a distribution $p(x)$, and
a good approximation to the prior $p(x)$, when can we sample from the posterior
$p(x \mid y)$? Posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for
tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, and several
heuristics attempt to approximate it. Unfortunately, approximate posterior
sampling is computationally intractable in general.
  To sidestep this hardness, we focus on (local or global) log-concave
distributions $p(x)$. In this regime, Langevin dynamics yields posterior
samples when the exact scores of $p(x)$ are available, but it is brittle to
score--estimation error, requiring an MGF bound (sub-exponential error). By
contrast, in the unconditional setting, diffusion models succeed with only an
$L^2$ bound on the score error. We prove that combining diffusion models with
an annealed variant of Langevin dynamics achieves conditional sampling in
polynomial time using merely an $L^4$ bound on the score error.

Abstract: We propose a graph-topological approach to active learning that directly

algorithm based on Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC), which selects
representative initial labels that reflect the graph's cluster structure. This
method includes a data-driven stopping criterion that signals when the graph
has been sufficiently explored. We further use BFC to dynamically trigger the
shift from exploration to exploitation within active learning routines,
replacing hand-tuned heuristics. To improve exploitation, we introduce a
localized graph rewiring strategy that efficiently incorporates multiscale
information around labeled nodes, enhancing label propagation while preserving
sparsity. Experiments on benchmark classification tasks show that our methods
consistently outperform existing graph-based semi-supervised baselines at low
label rates.

We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can act as in-context
meta-learners for this task. By converting each dataset into interpretable
metadata, we prompt an LLM to recommend both model families and
hyperparameters. We study two prompting strategies: (1) a zero-shot mode
relying solely on pretrained knowledge, and (2) a meta-informed mode augmented
with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Across synthetic
and real-world benchmarks, we show that LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to
recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, and that
improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrate their capacity for
in-context meta-learning. These results highlight a promising new role for LLMs
as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and
hyperparameter optimization.

Abstract: Shortcuts, spurious rules that perform well during training but fail to
generalize, present a major challenge to the reliability of deep networks
(Geirhos et al., 2020). However, the impact of shortcuts on feature
representations remains understudied, obstructing the design of principled
shortcut-mitigation methods. To overcome this limitation, we investigate the
layer-wise localization of shortcuts in deep models. Our novel experiment
design quantifies the layer-wise contribution to accuracy degradation caused by
a shortcut-inducing skew by counterfactual training on clean and skewed
datasets. We employ our design to study shortcuts on CIFAR-10, Waterbirds, and
CelebA datasets across VGG, ResNet, DeiT, and ConvNeXt architectures. We find
that shortcut learning is not localized in specific layers but distributed
throughout the network. Different network parts play different roles in this
process: shallow layers predominantly encode spurious features, while deeper
layers predominantly forget core features that are predictive on clean data. We
also analyze the differences in localization and describe its principal axes of
variation. Finally, our analysis of layer-wise shortcut-mitigation strategies
suggests the hardness of designing general methods, supporting dataset- and
architecture-specific approaches instead.

Abstract: Active learning has the potential to be especially useful for messy,
uncurated pools where datapoints vary in relevance to the target task. However,
state-of-the-art approaches to this problem currently rely on using fixed,
unsupervised representations of the pool, focusing on modifying the acquisition
function instead. We show that this model setup can undermine their
effectiveness at dealing with messy pools, as such representations can fail to
capture important information relevant to the task. To address this, we propose
using task-driven representations that are periodically updated during the
active learning process using the previously collected labels. We introduce two
specific strategies for learning these representations, one based on directly
learning semi-supervised representations and the other based on supervised
fine-tuning of an initial unsupervised representation. We find that both
significantly improve empirical performance over using unsupervised or
pretrained representations.

Abstract: Learning to defer uncertain predictions to costly experts offers a powerful
strategy for improving the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning systems.
However, standard training procedures for deferral algorithms typically require
querying all experts for every training instance, an approach that becomes
prohibitively expensive when expert queries incur significant computational or
resource costs. This undermines the core goal of deferral: to limit unnecessary
expert usage. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the budgeted deferral
framework, which aims to train effective deferral algorithms while minimizing
expert query costs during training. We propose new algorithms for both
two-stage and single-stage multiple-expert deferral settings that selectively
query only a subset of experts per training example. While inspired by active
learning, our setting is fundamentally different: labels are already known, and
the core challenge is to decide which experts to query in order to balance cost
and predictive performance. We establish theoretical guarantees for both of our
algorithms, including generalization bounds and label complexity analyses.
Empirical results across several domains show that our algorithms substantially
reduce training costs without sacrificing prediction accuracy, demonstrating
the practical value of our budget-aware deferral algorithms.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are valuable intellectual property, yet many
watermarks rely on backdoor triggers that break under common model edits and
create ownership ambiguity. We present InvGNN-WM, which ties ownership to a
model's implicit perception of a graph invariant, enabling trigger-free,
black-box verification with negligible task impact. A lightweight head predicts
normalized algebraic connectivity on an owner-private carrier set; a
sign-sensitive decoder outputs bits, and a calibrated threshold controls the
false-positive rate. Across diverse node and graph classification datasets and
backbones, InvGNN-WM matches clean accuracy while yielding higher watermark
accuracy than trigger- and compression-based baselines. It remains strong under
unstructured pruning, fine-tuning, and post-training quantization; plain
knowledge distillation (KD) weakens the mark, while KD with a watermark loss
(KD+WM) restores it. We provide guarantees for imperceptibility and robustness,
and we prove that exact removal is NP-complete.

Abstract: Can regularization terms in the training of invertible neural networks lead
to known Bayesian point estimators in reconstruction? Invertible networks are
attractive for inverse problems due to their inherent stability and
interpretability. Recently, optimization strategies for invertible neural
networks that approximate either a reconstruction map or the forward operator
have been studied from a Bayesian perspective, but each has limitations. To
address this, we introduce and analyze two regularization terms for the network
training that, upon inversion of the network, recover properties of classical
Bayesian point estimators: while the first can be connected to the posterior
mean, the second resembles the MAP estimator. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes how each loss shapes both the learned forward operator and its
inverse reconstruction map. Numerical experiments support our findings and
demonstrate how these loss-term regularizers introduce data-dependence in a
stable and interpretable way.

Abstract: In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been
predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between
entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how
memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of
Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of
the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must
have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global
relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in
turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition
into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding
geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,
despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly
attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.
Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more
succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry
stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed
arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also
points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more
strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages
revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like
knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.

Abstract: This paper introduces Modular Linear Tokenization (MLT), a reversible and
deterministic technique for encoding high-cardinality categorical identifiers
into compact numerical vectors. Unlike traditional hashing or one-hot
encodings, MLT preserves bijective mappings by leveraging modular arithmetic
over finite fields and invertible linear transformations. The method offers
explicit control of dimensionality and computational scalability while
maintaining full reversibility, even for millions of identifiers. Experimental
results on the MovieLens 20M dataset show that MLT achieves comparable
predictive performance to supervised embeddings while requiring significantly
fewer parameters and lower training cost. An open-source implementation of MLT
is available on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/light-mlt/) and GitHub
(https://github.com/tcharliesschmitz/light-mlt).

Abstract: The reliability of routine health data in low and middle-income countries
(LMICs) is often constrained by reporting delays and incomplete coverage,
necessitating the exploration of novel data sources and analytics. Geospatial
Foundation Models (GeoFMs) offer a promising avenue by synthesizing diverse
spatial, temporal, and behavioral data into mathematical embeddings that can be
efficiently used for downstream prediction tasks. This study evaluated the
predictive performance of three GeoFM embedding sources - Google Population
Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM), Google AlphaEarth (derived from satellite
imagery), and mobile phone call detail records (CDR) - for modeling 15 routine
health programmatic outputs in Malawi, and compared their utility to
traditional geospatial interpolation methods. We used XGBoost models on data
from 552 health catchment areas (January 2021-May 2023), assessing performance
with R2, and using an 80/20 training and test data split with 5-fold
cross-validation used in training. While predictive performance was mixed, the
embedding-based approaches improved upon baseline geostatistical methods in 13
of 15 (87%) indicators tested. A Multi-GeoFM model integrating all three
embedding sources produced the most robust predictions, achieving average
5-fold cross validated R2 values for indicators like population density (0.63),
new HIV cases (0.57), and child vaccinations (0.47) and test set R2 of 0.64,
0.68, and 0.55, respectively. Prediction was poor for prediction targets with
low primary data availability, such as TB and malnutrition cases. These results
demonstrate that GeoFM embeddings imbue a modest predictive improvement for
select health and demographic outcomes in an LMIC context. We conclude that the
integration of multiple GeoFM sources is an efficient and valuable tool for
supplementing and strengthening constrained routine health information systems.

Abstract: This paper surveys studies on the use of neural networks for optimization in
the training-data-free setting. Specifically, we examine the dataless
application of neural network architectures in optimization by
re-parameterizing problems using fully connected (or MLP), convolutional,
graph, and quadratic neural networks. Although MLPs have been used to solve
linear programs a few decades ago, this approach has recently gained increasing
attention due to its promising results across diverse applications, including
those based on combinatorial optimization, inverse problems, and partial
differential equations. The motivation for this setting stems from two key
(possibly over-lapping) factors: (i) data-driven learning approaches are still
underdeveloped and have yet to demonstrate strong results, as seen in
combinatorial optimization, and (ii) the availability of training data is
inherently limited, such as in medical image reconstruction and other
scientific applications. In this paper, we define the dataless setting and
categorize it into two variants based on how a problem instance -- defined by a
single datum -- is encoded onto the neural network: (i) architecture-agnostic
methods and (ii) architecture-specific methods. Additionally, we discuss
similarities and clarify distinctions between the dataless neural network (dNN)
settings and related concepts such as zero-shot learning, one-shot learning,
lifting in optimization, and over-parameterization.

Abstract: Differentiating through constrained optimization problems is increasingly
central to learning, control, and large-scale decision-making systems, yet
practical integration remains challenging due to solver specialization and
interface mismatches. This paper presents a general and streamlined
framework-an updated DiffOpt.jl-that unifies modeling and differentiation
within the Julia optimization stack. The framework computes forward - and
reverse-mode solution and objective sensitivities for smooth, potentially
nonconvex programs by differentiating the KKT system under standard regularity
assumptions. A first-class, JuMP-native parameter-centric API allows users to
declare named parameters and obtain derivatives directly with respect to them -
even when a parameter appears in multiple constraints and objectives -
eliminating brittle bookkeeping from coefficient-level interfaces. We
illustrate these capabilities on convex and nonconvex models, including
economic dispatch, mean-variance portfolio selection with conic risk
constraints, and nonlinear robot inverse kinematics. Two companion studies
further demonstrate impact at scale: gradient-based iterative methods for
strategic bidding in energy markets and Sobolev-style training of end-to-end
optimization proxies using solver-accurate sensitivities. Together, these
results demonstrate that differentiable optimization can be deployed as a
routine tool for experimentation, learning, calibration, and design-without
deviating from standard JuMP modeling practices and while retaining access to a
broad ecosystem of solvers.

Abstract: Robotic systems operating at the edge require efficient online learning
algorithms that can continuously adapt to changing environments while
processing streaming sensory data. Traditional backpropagation, while
effective, conflicts with biological plausibility principles and may be
suboptimal for continuous adaptation scenarios. The Predictive Coding (PC)
framework offers a biologically plausible alternative with local, Hebbian-like
update rules, making it suitable for neuromorphic hardware implementation.
However, PC's main limitation is its computational overhead due to multiple
inference iterations during training. We present Predictive Coding Network with
Temporal Amortization (PCN-TA), which preserves latent states across temporal
frames. By leveraging temporal correlations, PCN-TA significantly reduces
computational demands while maintaining learning performance. Our experiments
on the COIL-20 robotic perception dataset demonstrate that PCN-TA achieves 10%
fewer weight updates compared to backpropagation and requires 50% fewer
inference steps than baseline PC networks. These efficiency gains directly
translate to reduced computational overhead for moving another step toward edge
deployment and real-time adaptation support in resource-constrained robotic
systems. The biologically-inspired nature of our approach also makes it a
promising candidate for future neuromorphic hardware implementations, enabling
efficient online learning at the edge.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study the problem of infrequent exploration in linear bandits, addressing
a significant yet overlooked gap between fully adaptive exploratory methods
(e.g., UCB and Thompson Sampling), which explore potentially at every time
step, and purely greedy approaches, which require stringent diversity
assumptions to succeed. Continuous exploration can be impractical or unethical
in safety-critical or costly domains, while purely greedy strategies typically
fail without adequate contextual diversity. To bridge these extremes, we
introduce a simple and practical framework, INFEX, explicitly designed for
infrequent exploration. INFEX executes a base exploratory policy according to a
given schedule while predominantly choosing greedy actions in between. Despite
its simplicity, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that INFEX achieves
instance-dependent regret matching standard provably efficient algorithms,
provided the exploration frequency exceeds a logarithmic threshold.
Additionally, INFEX is a general, modular framework that allows seamless
integration of any fully adaptive exploration method, enabling wide
applicability and ease of adoption. By restricting intensive exploratory
computations to infrequent intervals, our approach can also enhance
computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations confirm our theoretical
findings, showing state-of-the-art regret performance and runtime improvements
over existing methods.

Abstract: Survival analysis is a task to model the time until an event of interest
occurs, widely used in clinical and biomedical research. A key challenge is to
model patient heterogeneity while also adapting risk predictions to both
individual characteristics and temporal dynamics. We propose a dual
mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for discrete-time survival analysis. Our
approach combines a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation
learning with a hazard MoE that leverages patient features and time embeddings
to capture temporal dynamics. This dual-MoE design flexibly integrates with
existing deep learning based survival pipelines. On METABRIC and GBSG breast
cancer datasets, our method consistently improves performance, boosting the
time-dependent C-index up to 0.04 on the test sets, and yields further gains
when incorporated into the Consurv framework.

Abstract: Do AI systems truly understand human concepts or merely mimic surface
patterns? We investigate this through chess, where human creativity meets
precise strategic concepts. Analyzing a 270M-parameter transformer that
achieves grandmaster-level play, we uncover a striking paradox: while early
layers encode human concepts like center control and knight outposts with up to
85\% accuracy, deeper layers, despite driving superior performance, drift
toward alien representations, dropping to 50-65\% accuracy. To test conceptual
robustness beyond memorization, we introduce the first Chess960 dataset: 240
expert-annotated positions across 6 strategic concepts. When opening theory is
eliminated through randomized starting positions, concept recognition drops
10-20\% across all methods, revealing the model's reliance on memorized
patterns rather than abstract understanding. Our layer-wise analysis exposes a
fundamental tension in current architectures: the representations that win
games diverge from those that align with human thinking. These findings suggest
that as AI systems optimize for performance, they develop increasingly alien
intelligence, a critical challenge for creative AI applications requiring
genuine human-AI collaboration. Dataset and code are available at:

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and
transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's
robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on
out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the
effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''
capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language
inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,
we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a
model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit
from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a
model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur
across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention
pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above
findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of
debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing
iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights
obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.
Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better
debiasing methods.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover the underlying mathematical
expressions that explain observed data. This holds promise for both gaining
scientific insight and for producing inherently interpretable and generalizable
models for tabular data. In this work we focus on the basics of SR. Deep
learning-based SR has recently become competitive with genetic programming
approaches, but the role of scale has remained largely unexplored. Inspired by
scaling laws in language modeling, we present the first systematic
investigation of scaling in SR, using a scalable end-to-end transformer
pipeline and carefully generated training data. Across five different model
sizes and spanning three orders of magnitude in compute, we find that both
validation loss and solved rate follow clear power-law trends with compute. We
further identify compute-optimal hyperparameter scaling: optimal batch size and
learning rate grow with model size, and a token-to-parameter ratio of
$\approx$15 is optimal in our regime, with a slight upward trend as compute
increases. These results demonstrate that SR performance is largely predictable
from compute and offer important insights for training the next generation of
SR models.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel paradigm for machine learning that moves beyond
traditional parameter optimization. Unlike conventional approaches that search
for optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to
treat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we
optimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,
thereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To
achieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function
carefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of
the manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,
while the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular
geometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the
computational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we
introduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the
continuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric
tensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using
automatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound
analogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general
relativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of
"data-driven geometry". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric
optimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with
fixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully
dynamic "meta-learners" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and
topology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as
scientific model discovery and robust representation learning.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising approach to address the
challenges of using sensitive financial data in machine learning applications.
By leveraging generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), it is possible to create artificial
datasets that preserve the statistical properties of real financial records
while mitigating privacy risks and regulatory constraints. Despite the rapid
growth of this field, a comprehensive synthesis of the current research
landscape has been lacking. This systematic review consolidates and analyses 72
studies published since 2018 that focus on synthetic financial data generation.
We categorise the types of financial information synthesised, the generative
methods employed, and the evaluation strategies used to assess data utility and
privacy. The findings indicate that GAN-based approaches dominate the
literature, particularly for generating time-series market data and tabular
credit data. While several innovative techniques demonstrate potential for
improved realism and privacy preservation, there remains a notable lack of
rigorous evaluation of privacy safeguards across studies. By providing an
integrated overview of generative techniques, applications, and evaluation
methods, this review highlights critical research gaps and offers guidance for
future work aimed at developing robust, privacy-preserving synthetic data
solutions for the financial domain.

Abstract: Specialized Generalist Models (SGMs) aim to preserve broad capabilities while
achieving expert-level performance in target domains. However, traditional LLM
structures including Transformer, Linear Attention, and hybrid models do not
employ specialized memory mechanism guided by task information. In this paper,
we present Nirvana, an SGM with specialized memory mechanism, linear time
complexity, and test-time task information extraction. Besides, we propose the
Task-Aware Memory Trigger ($\textit{Trigger}$) that flexibly adjusts memory
mechanism based on the current task's requirements. In Trigger, each incoming
sample is treated as a self-supervised fine-tuning task, enabling Nirvana to
adapt its task-related parameters on the fly to domain shifts. We also design
the Specialized Memory Updater ($\textit{Updater}$) that dynamically memorizes
the context guided by Trigger. We conduct experiments on both general language
tasks and specialized medical tasks. On a variety of natural language modeling
benchmarks, Nirvana achieves competitive or superior results compared to the
existing LLM structures. To prove the effectiveness of Trigger on specialized
tasks, we test Nirvana's performance on a challenging medical task, i.e.,
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We post-train frozen Nirvana backbone with
lightweight codecs on paired electromagnetic signals and MRI images. Despite
the frozen Nirvana backbone, Trigger guides the model to adapt to the MRI
domain with the change of task-related parameters. Nirvana achieves
higher-quality MRI reconstruction compared to conventional MRI models as well
as the models with traditional LLMs' backbone, and can also generate accurate
preliminary clinical reports accordingly.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Bug bisection has been an important security task that aims to understand the
range of software versions impacted by a bug, i.e., identifying the commit that
introduced the bug. However, traditional patch-based bisection methods are
faced with several significant barriers: For example, they assume that the
bug-inducing commit (BIC) and the patch commit modify the same functions, which
is not always true. They often rely solely on code changes, while the commit
message frequently contains a wealth of vulnerability-related information. They
are also based on simple heuristics (e.g., assuming the BIC initializes lines
deleted in the patch) and lack any logical analysis of the vulnerability.
  In this paper, we make the observation that Large Language Models (LLMs) are
well-positioned to break the barriers of existing solutions, e.g., comprehend
both textual data and code in patches and commits. Unlike previous BIC
identification approaches, which yield poor results, we propose a comprehensive
multi-stage pipeline that leverages LLMs to: (1) fully utilize patch
information, (2) compare multiple candidate commits in context, and (3)
progressively narrow down the candidates through a series of down-selection
steps. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly better accuracy than the state-of-the-art solution by more than
38\%. Our results further confirm that the comprehensive multi-stage pipeline
is essential, as it improves accuracy by 60\% over a baseline LLM-based
bisection method.

Abstract: Traffic congestion in urban road networks leads to longer trip times and
higher emissions, especially during peak periods. While the Shortest Path First
(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it
performs poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion
by routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle
routing through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for
coordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive
Navigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent
provides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood
state modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in
large networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation
(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections
(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles
micro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts
centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive
Q-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions
via attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local
congestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on
synthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces
average travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing
success. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up
to 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic. These findings highlight the
potential of network-constrained MARL for scalable, coordinated, and
congestion-aware routing in intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in machine learning is to assess model performance
based on average loss across all samples in some test set. This amounts to
averaging performance geospatially across the Earth in weather and climate
settings, failing to account for the non-uniform distribution of human
development and geography. We introduce Stratified Assessments of Forecasts
over Earth (SAFE), a package for elucidating the stratified performance of a
set of predictions made over Earth. SAFE integrates various data domains to
stratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints:
territory (usually country), global subregion, income, and landcover (land or
water). This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual
stratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual
country). To demonstrate its importance, we utilize SAFE to benchmark a zoo of
state-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models, finding that they all
exhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute. We use this to
seed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different
lead times for various climatic variables. By moving beyond globally-averaged
metrics, we for the first time ask: where do models perform best or worst, and
which models are most fair? To support further work in this direction, the SAFE
package is open source and available at https://github.com/N-Masi/safe

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has significantly
boosted the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) recently.
However, existing RLVR approaches merely train LLMs based on their own
generated responses and are constrained by the initial capability of LLMs, thus
prone to exploration stagnation, in which LLMs fail to solve more training
problems and cannot further learn from the training data. Some work tries to
address this by leveraging off-policy solutions to training problems but
requires external guidance from experts which suffers from limited
availability. In this work, we propose LTE (Learning to reason from Trial and
Error), an approach hinting LLMs with their previously self-generated incorrect
answers and problem of overlong responses, which does not require any external
expert guidance. Experiments validate the effectiveness of LTE, which
outperforms the normal group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by 6.38 in
Pass@1 and 9.00 in Pass@k on average across six mathematics benchmarks for
Qwen3-4B-Base. Further analysis confirms that LTE successfully mitigates the
problem of exploration stagnation and enhances both exploitation and
exploration during training.

Abstract: WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based human activity recognition (HAR)
provides a privacy-preserving, device-free sensing solution for smart
environments. However, its deployment on edge devices is severely constrained
by domain shift, where recognition performance deteriorates under varying
environmental and hardware conditions. This study presents maxVSTAR (maximally
adaptive Vision-guided Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), a
closed-loop, vision-guided model adaptation framework that autonomously
mitigates domain shift for edge-deployed CSI sensing systems. The proposed
system integrates a cross-modal teacher-student architecture, where a
high-accuracy YOLO-based vision model serves as a dynamic supervisory signal,
delivering real-time activity labels for the CSI data stream. These labels
enable autonomous, online fine-tuning of a lightweight CSI-based HAR model,
termed Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition (STAR), directly at the
edge. This closed-loop retraining mechanism allows STAR to continuously adapt
to environmental changes without manual intervention. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of maxVSTAR. When deployed on uncalibrated
hardware, the baseline STAR model's recognition accuracy declined from 93.52%
to 49.14%. Following a single vision-guided adaptation cycle, maxVSTAR restored
the accuracy to 81.51%. These results confirm the system's capacity for
dynamic, self-supervised model adaptation in privacy-conscious IoT
environments, establishing a scalable and practical paradigm for long-term
autonomous HAR using CSI sensing at the network edge.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) via Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI)
presents a privacy-preserving, contactless sensing approach suitable for smart
homes, healthcare monitoring, and mobile IoT systems. However, existing methods
often encounter computational inefficiency, high latency, and limited
feasibility within resource-constrained, embedded mobile edge environments.
This paper proposes STAR (Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), an
edge-AI-optimized framework that integrates a lightweight neural architecture,
adaptive signal processing, and hardware-aware co-optimization to enable
real-time, energy-efficient HAR on low-power embedded devices. STAR
incorporates a streamlined Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based recurrent neural
network, reducing model parameters by 33% compared to conventional LSTM models
while maintaining effective temporal modeling capability. A multi-stage
pre-processing pipeline combining median filtering, 8th-order Butterworth
low-pass filtering, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is employed to
denoise CSI amplitude data and extract spatial-temporal features. For on-device
deployment, STAR is implemented on a Rockchip RV1126 processor equipped with an
embedded Neural Processing Unit (NPU), interfaced with an ESP32-S3-based CSI
acquisition module. Experimental results demonstrate a mean recognition
accuracy of 93.52% across seven activity classes and 99.11% for human presence
detection, utilizing a compact 97.6k-parameter model. INT8 quantized inference
achieves a processing speed of 33 MHz with just 8% CPU utilization, delivering
sixfold speed improvements over CPU-based execution. With sub-second response
latency and low power consumption, the system ensures real-time,
privacy-preserving HAR, offering a practical, scalable solution for mobile and
pervasive computing environments.

Abstract: Molecule and text representation learning has gained increasing interest due
to its potential for enhancing the understanding of chemical information.
However, existing models often struggle to capture subtle differences between
molecules and their descriptions, as they lack the ability to learn
fine-grained alignments between molecular substructures and chemical phrases.
To address this limitation, we introduce MolBridge, a novel molecule-text
learning framework based on substructure-aware alignments. Specifically, we
augment the original molecule-description pairs with additional alignment
signals derived from molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To
effectively learn from these enriched alignments, MolBridge employs
substructure-aware contrastive learning, coupled with a self-refinement
mechanism that filters out noisy alignment signals. Experimental results show
that MolBridge effectively captures fine-grained correspondences and
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of molecular benchmarks,
highlighting the significance of substructure-aware alignment in molecule-text
learning.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of advanced feature
engineering and hybrid model architectures for anomaly detection in a
multivariate industrial time series, focusing on a steam turbine system. We
evaluate the impact of change point-derived statistical features,
clustering-based substructure representations, and hybrid learning strategies
on detection performance. Despite their theoretical appeal, these complex
approaches consistently underperformed compared to a simple Random Forest +
XGBoost ensemble trained on segmented data. The ensemble achieved an AUC-ROC of
0.976, F1-score of 0.41, and 100% early detection within the defined time
window. Our findings highlight that, in scenarios with highly imbalanced and
temporally uncertain data, model simplicity combined with optimized
segmentation can outperform more sophisticated architectures, offering greater
robustness, interpretability, and operational utility.

Abstract: Public resource allocation involves the efficient distribution of resources,
including urban infrastructure, energy, and transportation, to effectively meet
societal demands. However, existing methods focus on optimizing the movement of
individual resources independently, without considering their capacity
constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and more practical
problem: Collaborative Public Resource Allocation (CPRA), which explicitly
incorporates capacity constraints and spatio-temporal dynamics in real-world
scenarios. We propose a new framework called Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal
Reinforcement Learning (GSTRL) for solving CPRA. Our contributions are twofold:
1) We formulate the CPRA problem as a potential game and demonstrate that there
is no gap between the potential function and the optimal target, laying a solid
theoretical foundation for approximating the Nash equilibrium of this NP-hard
problem; and 2) Our designed GSTRL framework effectively captures the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the overall system. We evaluate GSTRL on two
real-world datasets, where experiments show its superior performance. Our
source codes are available in the supplementary materials.

Abstract: Modern data-centric AI needs precise per-sample influence. Standard SGD-IE
approximates leave-one-out effects by summing per-epoch surrogates and ignores
cross-epoch compounding, which misranks critical examples. We propose
ACC-SGD-IE, a trajectory-aware estimator that propagates the leave-one-out
perturbation across training and updates an accumulative influence state at
each step. In smooth strongly convex settings it achieves geometric error
contraction and, in smooth non-convex regimes, it tightens error bounds; larger
mini-batches further reduce constants. Empirically, on Adult, 20 Newsgroups,
and MNIST under clean and corrupted data and both convex and non-convex
training, ACC-SGD-IE yields more accurate influence estimates, especially over
long epochs. For downstream data cleansing it more reliably flags noisy
samples, producing models trained on ACC-SGD-IE cleaned data that outperform
those cleaned with SGD-IE.

Abstract: Reducing preventable hospital readmissions is a national priority for payers,
providers, and policymakers seeking to improve health care and lower costs. The
rate of readmission is being used as a benchmark to determine the quality of
healthcare provided by the hospitals. In thisproject, we have used machine
learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector
Machines to analyze the health claims data and identify demographic and medical
factors that play a crucial role in predicting all-cause readmissions. As the
health claims data is high dimensional, we have used Principal Component
Analysis as a dimension reduction technique and used the results for building
regression models. We compared and evaluated these models based on the Area
Under Curve (AUC) metric. Random Forest model gave the highest performance
followed by Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models. These models
can be used to identify the crucial factors causing readmissions and help
identify patients to focus on to reduce the chances of readmission, ultimately
bringing down the cost and increasing the quality of healthcare provided to the
patients.

Abstract: Test-time alignment of large language models (LLMs) attracts attention
because fine-tuning LLMs requires high computational costs. In this paper, we
propose a new test-time alignment method called adaptive importance sampling on
pre-logits (AISP) on the basis of the sampling-based model predictive control
with the stochastic control input. AISP applies the Gaussian perturbation into
pre-logits, which are outputs of the penultimate layer, so as to maximize
expected rewards with respect to the mean of the perturbation. We demonstrate
that the optimal mean is obtained by importance sampling with sampled rewards.
AISP outperforms best-of-n sampling in terms of rewards over the number of used
samples and achieves higher rewards than other reward-based test-time alignment
methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As a new and promising approach, existing machine unlearning (MU) works
typically emphasize theoretical formulations or optimization objectives to
achieve knowledge removal. However, when deployed in real-world scenarios, such
solutions typically face scalability issues and have to address practical
requirements such as full access to original datasets and model. In contrast to
the existing approaches, we regard classification training as a sequential
process where classes are learned sequentially, which we call \emph{inductive
approach}. Unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence.
This is implemented by appending a projection-redistribution layer in the end
of the model. Such an approach does not require full access to the original
dataset or the model, addressing the challenges of existing methods. This
enables modular and model-agnostic deployment as an output filter into existing
classification pipelines with minimal alterations. We conducted multiple
experiments across multiple datasets including image (CIFAR-10/100 using
CNN-based model) and tabular datasets (Covertype using tree-based model).
Experiment results show consistently similar output to a fully retrained model
with a high computational cost reduction. This demonstrates the applicability,
scalability, and system compatibility of our solution while maintaining the
performance of the output in a more practical setting.

Abstract: Controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving
their general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable
artificial intelligence deployment. Current steering methods, such as vector
addition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional
subspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive
to chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to
unintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a
novel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating
activations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as
a geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular
Steering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as
refusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering
emotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular
Steering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the
target feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering
generalizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified
geometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining
model stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across
multiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust
behavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,
underscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior
approaches. Code and artifacts are available at

Abstract: Interpolation in generative models allows for controlled generation, model
inspection, and more. Unfortunately, most generative models lack a principal
notion of interpolants without restrictive assumptions on either the model or
data dimension. In this paper, we develop a general interpolation scheme that
targets likely transition paths compatible with different metrics and
probability distributions. We consider interpolants analogous to a geodesic
constrained to a suitable data distribution and derive a novel algorithm for
computing these curves, which requires no additional training. Theoretically,
we show that our method locally can be considered as a geodesic under a
suitable Riemannian metric. We quantitatively show that our interpolation
scheme traverses higher density regions than baselines across a range of models
and datasets.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been successful in learning complex data distributions.
This capability has driven their application to high-dimensional
multi-objective black-box optimization problem. Existing approaches often
employ an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the
diffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a
black-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the
diffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)
algorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate
samples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG
performs weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according
to the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling
strategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to
our desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the
multi-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood
interpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional
multi-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective
molecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single
generation pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline
optimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.
Notably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can
be integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.

Abstract: Multi-task learning in contextual bandits has attracted significant research
interest due to its potential to enhance decision-making across multiple
related tasks by leveraging shared structures and task-specific heterogeneity.
In this article, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for
learning in various bandit instances. This framework captures both the
heterogeneity and the correlations among different bandit instances through a
hierarchical Bayesian model, enabling effective information sharing while
accommodating instance-specific variations. Unlike previous methods that
overlook the learning of the covariance structure across bandits, we introduce
an empirical Bayesian approach to estimate the covariance matrix of the prior
distribution.This enhances both the practicality and flexibility of learning
across multi-bandits. Building on this approach, we develop two efficient
algorithms: ebmTS (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Thompson Sampling) and
ebmUCB (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Upper Confidence Bound), both of which
incorporate the estimated prior into the decision-making process. We provide
the frequentist regret upper bounds for the proposed algorithms, thereby
filling a research gap in the field of multi-bandit problems. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior
performance of our algorithms, particularly in complex environments. Our
methods achieve lower cumulative regret compared to existing techniques,
highlighting their effectiveness in balancing exploration and exploitation
across multi-bandits.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Preference learning from pairwise feedback is a widely adopted framework in
applications such as reinforcement learning with human feedback and
recommendations. In many practical settings, however, user interactions are
limited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover,
real-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences.
For example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses
differently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying
similarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under
scenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling
the imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are
underrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering
of Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets
from multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize
utility for a test user. To tackle the first challenge, we first propose
Off-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on
offline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that
explicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the
second challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting
with active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited
number of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster
structure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm,
A$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative
dimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively
collected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones. Finally, we
validate our theoretical results through simulations on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) delivers strong cross modal
generalization by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space, yet it
persistently fails at compositional reasoning over objects, attributes, and
relations often behaving like a bag-of-words matcher. Prior causal accounts
typically model text as a single vector, obscuring token-level structure and
leaving core phenomena-such as prompt sensitivity and failures on hard
negatives unexplained. We address this gap with a token-aware causal
representation learning (CRL) framework grounded in a sequential,
language-token SCM. Our theory extends block identifiability to tokenized text,
proving that CLIP's contrastive objective can recover the modal-invariant
latent variable under both sentence-level and token-level SCMs. Crucially,
token granularity yields the first principled explanation of CLIP's
compositional brittleness: composition nonidentifiability. We show the
existence of pseudo-optimal text encoders that achieve perfect modal-invariant
alignment yet are provably insensitive to SWAP, REPLACE, and ADD operations
over atomic concepts, thereby failing to distinguish correct captions from hard
negatives despite optimizing the same training objective as true-optimal
encoders. The analysis further links language-side nonidentifiability to
visual-side failures via the modality gap and shows how iterated composition
operators compound hardness, motivating improved negative mining strategies.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to incrementally train a model on a sequence of
tasks while retaining performance on prior ones. However, storing and replaying
data is often infeasible due to privacy or security constraints and impractical
for arbitrary pre-trained models. Data-free CL seeks to update models without
access to previous data. Beyond regularization, we employ model inversion to
synthesize data from the trained model, enabling replay without storing
samples. Yet, model inversion in predictive models faces two challenges: (1)
generating inputs solely from compressed output labels causes drift between
synthetic and real data, and replaying such data can erode prior knowledge; (2)
inversion is computationally expensive since each step backpropagates through
the full model. These issues are amplified in large pre-trained models such as
CLIP. To improve efficiency, we propose Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI),
inspired by faster convergence in single-layer optimization. PMI provides
strong initialization for full-model inversion, substantially reducing
iterations. To mitigate feature shift, we model class-wise features via
Gaussian distributions and contrastive model, ensuring alignment between
synthetic and real features. Combining PMI and feature modeling, our approach
enables continual learning of new classes by generating pseudo-images from
semantic-aware projected features, achieving strong effectiveness and
compatibility across multiple CL settings.

Abstract: Training Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be formulated as a QUBO problem,
enabling the use of quantum annealing for model optimization. In this work, we
study how the number of qubits - linked to the discretization level of dual
weights - affects predictive performance across datasets. We compare QUBO-based
SVM training to the classical LIBSVM solver and find that even low-precision
QUBO encodings (e.g., 1 bit per parameter) yield competitive, and sometimes
superior, accuracy. While increased bit-depth enables larger regularization
parameters, it does not always improve classification. Our findings suggest
that selecting the right support vectors may matter more than their precise
weighting. Although current hardware limits the size of solvable QUBOs, our
results highlight the potential of quantum annealing for efficient SVM training
as quantum devices scale.

Abstract: Enabling continual learning in LLMs remains a key unresolved research
challenge. In a recent announcement, a frontier LLM company made a step towards
this by introducing Agent Skills, a framework that equips agents with new
knowledge based on instructions stored in simple markdown files. Although Agent
Skills can be a very useful tool, we show that they are fundamentally insecure,
since they enable trivially simple prompt injections. We demonstrate how to
hide malicious instructions in long Agent Skill files and referenced scripts to
exfiltrate sensitive data, such as internal files or passwords. Importantly, we
show how to bypass system-level guardrails of a popular coding agent: a benign,
task-specific approval with the "Don't ask again" option can carry over to
closely related but harmful actions. Overall, we conclude that despite ongoing
research efforts and scaling model capabilities, frontier LLMs remain
vulnerable to very simple prompt injections in realistic scenarios. Our code is

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining
causal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.
In this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed
interventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional
data. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,
interventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of
inequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset
(Sachs et al.\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3
exerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow
enforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from
PIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as
learning that "PIP3 inhibits Akt". Interventional constraints bridge this gap
by explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,
ensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize
interventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal
effects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained
optimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We
evaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating
interventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures
consistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also
facilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be
costly to identify.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed to optimize
problem-solving by learning actions that maximize rewards, a task that becomes
particularly challenging in random and nonstationary environments. Even
advanced RL algorithms are often limited in their ability to solve problems in
these conditions. In applications such as searching for underwater pollution
clouds with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), RL algorithms must navigate
reward-sparse environments, where actions frequently result in a zero reward.
This paper aims to address these challenges by revisiting and modifying
classical RL approaches to efficiently operate in sparse, randomized, and
nonstationary environments. We systematically study a large number of
modifications, including hierarchical algorithm changes, multigoal learning,
and the integration of a location memory as an external output filter to
prevent state revisits. Our results demonstrate that a modified Monte
Carlo-based approach significantly outperforms traditional Q-learning and two
exhaustive search patterns, illustrating its potential in adapting RL to
complex environments. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning
approaches can be effectively adapted for use in random, nonstationary, and
reward-sparse environments.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative model
training across multiple clients without sharing raw data, enabling
privacy-preserving applications in areas such as radiology and pathology.
However, works on collaborative training across clients with fundamentally
different neural architectures and non-identically distributed datasets remain
scarce. Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to
support architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate
variants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs),
still presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate
federations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g.,
CNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical
heterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each
client's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time,
undermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures,
have non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains,
current methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose
UnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous
local networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a
shared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to
parameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean
distances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy
balancing convergence and diversity. Experiments on MedMNIST classification and
hippocampus segmentation benchmarks demonstrate UnifiedFL's superior
performance. Code and data: https://github.com/basiralab/UnifiedFL

Abstract: Financial forecasting increasingly uses large neural network models, but
their opacity raises challenges for trust and regulatory compliance. We present
several approaches to explainable and reliable AI in finance. \emph{First}, we
describe how Time-LLM, a time series foundation model, uses a prompt to avoid a
wrong directional forecast. \emph{Second}, we show that combining foundation
models for time series forecasting with a reliability estimator can filter our
unreliable predictions. \emph{Third}, we argue for symbolic reasoning encoding
domain rules for transparent justification. These approaches shift emphasize
executing only forecasts that are both reliable and explainable. Experiments on
equity and cryptocurrency data show that the architecture reduces false
positives and supports selective execution. By integrating predictive
performance with reliability estimation and rule-based reasoning, our framework
advances transparent and auditable financial AI systems.

Abstract: Worker location data is key to higher productivity in industrial sites.
Cameras are a promising tool for localization in logistics warehouses since
they also offer valuable environmental contexts such as package status.
However, identifying individuals with only visual data is often impractical.
Accordingly, several prior studies identified people in videos by comparing
their trajectories and wearable sensor measurements. While this approach has
advantages such as independence from appearance, the existing methods may break
down under real-world conditions. To overcome this challenge, we propose CorVS,
a novel data-driven person identification method based on correspondence
between visual tracking trajectories and sensor measurements. Firstly, our deep
learning model predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for
every pair of a trajectory and sensor measurements. Secondly, our algorithm
matches the trajectories and sensor measurements over time using the predicted
probabilities and reliabilities. We developed a dataset with actual warehouse
operations and demonstrated the method's effectiveness for real-world
applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) are key sources of subseasonal
predictability and major drivers of extreme winter weather. Yet, their accurate
and efficient forecast remains a persistent challenge for numerical weather
prediction (NWP) systems due to limitations in physical representation,
initialization, and the immense computational demands of ensemble forecasts.
While data-driven forecasting is rapidly evolving, its application to the
complex, three-dimensional dynamics of SSWs, particularly for probabilistic
forecast, remains underexplored. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow
Matching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful
probabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric
circulation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast
skillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20
days in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%. Its performance is
comparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while requiring only two minutes
for a 50-member, 30-day forecast on a consumer GPU. Furthermore, leveraging
FM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that
SSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers,
distinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by
internal stratospheric dynamics. Our work thus establishes a computationally
efficient paradigm for probabilistic forecasting stratospheric anomalies and
showcases generative AI's potential to deepen the physical understanding of
atmosphere-climate dynamics.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables simultaneous training across related tasks,
leveraging shared information to improve generalization, efficiency, and
robustness, especially in data-scarce or high-dimensional scenarios. While deep
learning dominates recent MTL research, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Twin
SVMs (TWSVMs) remain relevant due to their interpretability, theoretical rigor,
and effectiveness with small datasets.
  This chapter surveys MTL approaches based on SVM and TWSVM, highlighting
shared representations, task regularization, and structural coupling
strategies. Special attention is given to emerging TWSVM extensions for
multi-task settings, which show promise but remain underexplored. We compare
these models in terms of theoretical properties, optimization strategies, and
empirical performance, and discuss applications in fields such as computer
vision, natural language processing, and bioinformatics.
  Finally, we identify research gaps and outline future directions for building
scalable, interpretable, and reliable margin-based MTL frameworks. This work
provides a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners interested
in SVM- and TWSVM-based multi-task learning.

Abstract: Adapting pre-trained video generation models into controllable world models
via latent actions is a promising step towards creating generalist world
models. The dominant paradigm adopts a two-stage approach that trains latent
action model (LAM) and the world model separately, resulting in redundant
training and limiting their potential for co-adaptation. A conceptually simple
and appealing idea is to directly replace the forward dynamic model in LAM with
a powerful world model and training them jointly, but it is non-trivial and
prone to representational collapse. In this work, we propose CoLA-World, which
for the first time successfully realizes this synergistic paradigm, resolving
the core challenge in joint learning through a critical warm-up phase that
effectively aligns the representations of the from-scratch LAM with the
pre-trained world model. This unlocks a co-evolution cycle: the world model
acts as a knowledgeable tutor, providing gradients to shape a high-quality LAM,
while the LAM offers a more precise and adaptable control interface to the
world model. Empirically, CoLA-World matches or outperforms prior two-stage
methods in both video simulation quality and downstream visual planning,
establishing a robust and efficient new paradigm for the field.

Abstract: Personalized treatment outcome prediction based on trial data for
small-sample and rare patient groups is critical in precision medicine.
However, the costly trial data limit the prediction performance. To address
this issue, we propose a cross-fidelity knowledge distillation and adaptive
fusion network (CFKD-AFN), which leverages abundant but low-fidelity simulation
data to enhance predictions on scarce but high-fidelity trial data. CFKD-AFN
incorporates a dual-channel knowledge distillation module to extract
complementary knowledge from the low-fidelity model, along with an
attention-guided fusion module to dynamically integrate multi-source
information. Experiments on treatment outcome prediction for the chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease demonstrates significant improvements of CFKD-AFN
over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, ranging from 6.67\% to
74.55\%, and strong robustness to varying high-fidelity dataset sizes.
Furthermore, we extend CFKD-AFN to an interpretable variant, enabling the
exploration of latent medical semantics to support clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Graph condensation (GC) has gained significant attention for its ability to
synthesize smaller yet informative graphs. However, existing studies often
overlook the robustness of GC in scenarios where the original graph is
corrupted. In such cases, we observe that the performance of GC deteriorates
significantly, while existing robust graph learning technologies offer only
limited effectiveness. Through both empirical investigation and theoretical
analysis, we reveal that GC is inherently an intrinsic-dimension-reducing
process, synthesizing a condensed graph with lower classification complexity.
Although this property is critical for effective GC performance, it remains
highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. To tackle this vulnerability
and improve GC robustness, we adopt the geometry perspective of graph data
manifold and propose a novel Manifold-constrained Robust Graph Condensation
framework named MRGC. Specifically, we introduce three graph data manifold
learning modules that guide the condensed graph to lie within a smooth,
low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity, thereby preserving the
classification complexity reduction capability of GC and ensuring robust
performance under universal adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the robustness of \ModelName\ across diverse attack scenarios.

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) is
often bottlenecked by the generation stage, which can consume over 75\% of the
training time. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates autoregressive generation
in serving systems, but its behavior under RL training remains largely
unexplored. We identify three critical gaps that hinder the naive integration
of SD into RL systems: diminishing speedups at large batch sizes, drafter
staleness under continual actor updates, and drafter-induced policy
degradation.
  To address these gaps, we present ReSpec, a system that adapts SD to RL
through three complementary mechanisms: dynamically tuning SD configurations,
evolving the drafter via knowledge distillation, and weighting updates by
rollout rewards. On Qwen models (3B--14B), ReSpec achieves up to 4.5x speedup
while preserving reward convergence and training stability, providing a
practical solution for efficient RL-based LLM adaptation.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in time-series data is a critical challenge with
significant implications for network security. Recent quantum machine learning
approaches, such as quantum kernel methods and variational quantum circuits,
have shown promise in capturing complex data distributions for anomaly
detection but remain constrained by limited qubit counts. We introduce in this
work a novel Quantum Gated Recurrent Unit (QGRU)-based Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) employing Successive Data Injection (SuDaI) and a multi-metric
gating strategy for robust network anomaly detection. Our model uniquely
utilizes a quantum-enhanced generator that outputs parameters (mean and
log-variance) of a Gaussian distribution via reparameterization, combined with
a Wasserstein critic to stabilize adversarial training. Anomalies are
identified through a novel gating mechanism that initially flags potential
anomalies based on Gaussian uncertainty estimates and subsequently verifies
them using a composite of critic scores and reconstruction errors. Evaluated on
benchmark datasets, our method achieves a high time-series aware F1 score
(TaF1) of 89.43% demonstrating superior capability in detecting anomalies
accurately and promptly as compared to existing classical and quantum models.
Furthermore, the trained QGRU-WGAN was deployed on real IBM Quantum hardware,
where it retained high anomaly detection performance, confirming its robustness
and practical feasibility on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
devices.

Abstract: Data selection is a critical aspect of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Current data selection methods are largely heuristic-based,
lacking theoretical guarantees and generalizability. This work proposes a
theoretically-grounded approach using influence functions to estimate the
contribution of each data point to the learning objective. To overcome the
prohibitive computational cost of policy rollouts required for online influence
estimation, we introduce an off-policy influence estimation method that
efficiently approximates data influence using pre-collected offline
trajectories. Furthermore, to manage the high-dimensional gradients of LLMs, we
employ sparse random projection to reduce dimensionality and improve storage
and computation efficiency. Leveraging these techniques, we develop
\textbf{C}urriculum \textbf{R}L with \textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy
\text{I}nfluence guidance (\textbf{CROPI}), a multi-stage RL framework that
iteratively selects the most influential data for the current policy.
Experiments on models up to 7B parameters demonstrate that CROPI significantly
accelerates training. On a 1.5B model, it achieves a 2.66x step-level
acceleration while using only 10\% of the data per stage compared to
full-dataset training. Our results highlight the substantial potential of
influence-based data selection for efficient RLVR.

Abstract: Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring via wearables offers
significant potential for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection.
However, deploying deep learning models for automated analysis in
resource-constrained environments faces reliability challenges due to
inevitable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. OOD inputs, such as unseen
pathologies or noisecorrupted signals, often cause erroneous, high-confidence
predictions by standard classifiers, compromising patient safety. Existing OOD
detection methods either neglect computational constraints or address noise and
unseen classes separately. This paper explores Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
(UAD) as an independent, upstream filtering mechanism to improve robustness. We
benchmark six UAD approaches, including Deep SVDD, reconstruction-based models,
Masked Anomaly Detection, normalizing flows, and diffusion models, optimized
via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) under strict resource constraints (at most
512k parameters). Evaluation on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets assessed detection
of OOD CVD classes and signals unsuitable for analysis due to noise. Results
show Deep SVDD consistently achieves the best trade-off between detection and
efficiency. In a realistic deployment simulation, integrating the optimized
Deep SVDD filter with a diagnostic classifier improved accuracy by up to 21
percentage points over a classifier-only baseline. This study demonstrates that
optimized UAD filters can safeguard automated ECG analysis, enabling safer,
more reliable continuous cardiovascular monitoring on wearables.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods, such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have achieved remarkable progress
in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
However, they exhibit limited exploration due to reliance on on-policy rollouts
where confined to the current policy's distribution, resulting in narrow
trajectory diversity. Recent approaches attempt to expand policy coverage by
incorporating trajectories generated from stronger expert models, yet this
reliance increases computational cost and such advaned models are often
inaccessible. To address these issues, we propose In-Context Steered Policy
Optimization (ICPO), a unified framework that leverages the inherent in-context
learning capability of LRMs to provide expert guidance using existing datasets.
ICPO introduces Mixed-Policy GRPO with Implicit Expert Forcing, which expands
exploration beyond the current policy distribution without requiring advanced
LRM trajectories. To further stabilize optimization, ICPO integrates Expert
Region Reject Sampling to filter unreliable off-policy trajectories and
Annealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping to balance early expert guidance with
later autonomous improvement. Results demonstrate that ICPO consistently
enhances reinforcement learning performance and training stability on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, revealing a scalable and effective RLVR
paradigm for LRMs.

Abstract: Inference latency stands as a critical bottleneck in the large-scale
deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Speculative decoding methods have
recently shown promise in accelerating inference without compromising the
output distribution. However, existing work typically relies on a dualistic
draft-verify framework and lacks rigorous theoretical grounding. In this paper,
we introduce a novel \emph{polybasic} speculative decoding framework,
underpinned by a comprehensive theoretical analysis. Specifically, we prove a
fundamental theorem that characterizes the optimal inference time for
multi-model speculative decoding systems, shedding light on how to extend
beyond the dualistic approach to a more general polybasic paradigm. Through our
theoretical investigation of multi-model token generation, we expose and
optimize the interplay between model capabilities, acceptance lengths, and
overall computational cost. Our framework supports both standalone
implementation and integration with existing speculative techniques, leading to
accelerated performance in practice. Experimental results across multiple model
families demonstrate that our approach yields speedup ratios ranging from
$3.31\times$ to $4.01\times$ for LLaMA2-Chat 7B, up to $3.87 \times$ for
LLaMA3-8B, up to $4.43 \times$ for Vicuna-7B and up to $3.85 \times$ for
Qwen2-7B -- all while preserving the original output distribution. We release
our theoretical proofs and implementation code to facilitate further
investigation into polybasic speculative decoding.

Abstract: A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.
Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the
embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for
enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic
settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and
degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation
quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or
entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask
whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve
world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly
accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing
a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We
propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that
consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent
representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent
representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.
GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales
with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative
backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,
GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that
its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric
structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation
learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering
reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.

principled alternative to classical hypergraph regularization, enforcing
higher-order smoothness via powers of multiscale Laplacians induced by the
hypergraph structure. Prior work established the well- and ill-posedness of
HOHL through an asymptotic consistency analysis in geometric settings. We
extend this theoretical foundation by proving the consistency of a truncated
version of HOHL and deriving explicit convergence rates when HOHL is used as a
regularizer in fully supervised learning. We further demonstrate its strong
empirical performance in active learning and in datasets lacking an underlying
geometric structure, highlighting HOHL's versatility and robustness across
diverse learning settings.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often
suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and
inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue
through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its
root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted
BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that
breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we
demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this
mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only
a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model
architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16
uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger
performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these
findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL
fine-tuning.

Abstract: The use of ML in engineering has grown steadily to support a wide array of
applications. Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely
adopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large,
high-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or
insufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which
leverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in
data-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where
pretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain
shifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by
learning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under
greater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be
unstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty
quantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,
the staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that
combines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a
deterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature
extractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a
Bayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for
fine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield
calibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first
validated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly
outperform standard transfer techniques. It was then applied to the task of
predicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels, leveraging data from
tube experiments as the source domain. The results of this study show that the
staged B-DANN method can improve predictive accuracy and generalization,
potentially assisting other domains in nuclear engineering.

compression scheme for boosted decision trees, addressing the growing need for
lightweight machine learning models. Specifically, we provide techniques for
training compact boosted decision tree ensembles that exhibit a reduced memory
footprint by rewarding, among other things, the reuse of features and
thresholds during training. Our experimental evaluation shows that models
achieved the same performance with a compression ratio of 4-16x compared to
LightGBM models using an adapted training process and an alternative memory
layout. Once deployed, the corresponding IoT devices can operate independently
of constant communication or external energy supply, and, thus, autonomously,
requiring only minimal computing power and energy. This capability opens the

Abstract: Developing trustworthy Machine Learning (ML) models requires their predicted
probabilities to be well-calibrated, meaning they should reflect true-class
frequencies. Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong
calibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities
to be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing
approaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs,
which makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of
the feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant
in high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are
exactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this
main shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration.
First, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its
relationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the
pitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local
calibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local
calibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted
probabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon
distance. Finally, we empirically validate our approach against existing
multiclass calibration techniques.

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of regression over distributions, which is
becoming increasingly important in machine learning. Existing approaches often
ignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive.
To overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the
parameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the
minimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is
to model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined
by a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and
covariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein
polynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance
between the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which
takes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based
optimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic
datasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed
method provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein
distance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced
nonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than
or comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,
while maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via
control points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that
combines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability.
Prospects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian
distributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and
adapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating
surfaces and more complex structures.

Abstract: We introduce Aeolus, a large-scale Multi-modal Flight Delay Dataset designed
to advance research on flight delay prediction and support the development of
foundation models for tabular data. Existing datasets in this domain are
typically limited to flat tabular structures and fail to capture the
spatiotemporal dynamics inherent in delay propagation. Aeolus addresses this
limitation by providing three aligned modalities: (i) a tabular dataset with
rich operational, meteorological, and airportlevel features for over 50 million
flights; (ii) a flight chain module that models delay propagation along
sequential flight legs, capturing upstream and downstream dependencies; and
(iii) a flight network graph that encodes shared aircraft, crew, and airport
resource connections, enabling cross-flight relational reasoning. The dataset
is carefully constructed with temporal splits, comprehensive features, and
strict leakage prevention to support realistic and reproducible machine
learning evaluation. Aeolus supports a broad range of tasks, including
regression, classification, temporal structure modeling, and graph learning,
serving as a unified benchmark across tabular, sequential, and graph
modalities. We release baseline experiments and preprocessing tools to
facilitate adoption. Aeolus fills a key gap for both domain-specific modeling
and general-purpose structured data research.Our source code and data can be

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has the potential to solve various combinatorial
tasks, ranging from materials science to neural architecture search. However,
BO requires specialized kernels to effectively model combinatorial domains.
Recent efforts have introduced several combinatorial kernels, but the
relationships among them are not well understood. To bridge this gap, we
develop a unifying framework based on heat kernels, which we derive in a
systematic way and express as simple closed-form expressions. Using this
framework, we prove that many successful combinatorial kernels are either
related or equivalent to heat kernels, and validate this theoretical claim in
our experiments. Moreover, our analysis confirms and extends the results
presented in Bounce: certain algorithms' performance decreases substantially
when the unknown optima of the function do not have a certain structure. In
contrast, heat kernels are not sensitive to the location of the optima. Lastly,
we show that a fast and simple pipeline, relying on heat kernels, is able to
achieve state-of-the-art results, matching or even outperforming certain slow
or complex algorithms.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental task for time series analytics with
important implications for the downstream performance of many applications.
Despite increasing academic interest and the large number of methods proposed
in the literature, recent benchmarks and evaluation studies demonstrated that
no overall best anomaly detection methods exist when applied to very
heterogeneous time series datasets. Therefore, the only scalable and viable
solution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected
from diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select,
based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to
run. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to
time series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based
approaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper
studies the performance of time series classification methods used as model
selection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations
derived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we
propose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series
classification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results
demonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly
detection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution
time. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and
efficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and
represents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection
step in general AutoML pipelines. Preprint version of an article accepted at

Abstract: Modeling the transport dynamics of natural processes from population-level
observations is a ubiquitous problem in the natural sciences. Such models rely
on key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful
learning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de
facto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action
that results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an
energy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world
systems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit
non-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by
current state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this
paper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is
capable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a
Schr\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in
stark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is
constructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.
We showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single
cells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate
velocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better
match both the reference process and population marginals. Curly-FM expands
flow matching models beyond the modeling of populations and towards the
modeling of known periodic behavior in physical systems. Our code repository is

Abstract: We revisit the task of computing the span of the top $r$ singular vectors
$u_1, \ldots, u_r$ of a matrix under differential privacy. We show that a
simple and efficient algorithm -- based on singular value decomposition and
standard perturbation mechanisms -- returns a private rank-$r$ approximation
whose error depends only on the \emph{rank-$r$ coherence} of $u_1, \ldots, u_r$
and the spectral gap $\sigma_r - \sigma_{r+1}$. This resolves a question posed
by Hardt and Roth~\cite{hardt2013beyond}. Our estimator outperforms the state
of the art -- significantly so in some regimes. In particular, we show that in
the dense setting, it achieves the same guarantees for single-spike PCA in the
Wishart model as those attained by optimal non-private algorithms, whereas
prior private algorithms failed to do so.
  In addition, we prove that (rank-$r$) coherence does not increase under
Gaussian perturbations. This implies that any estimator based on the Gaussian
mechanism -- including ours -- preserves the coherence of the input. We
conjecture that similar behavior holds for other structured models, including
planted problems in graphs.
  We also explore applications of coherence to graph problems. In particular,
we present a differentially private algorithm for Max-Cut and other constraint
satisfaction problems under low coherence assumptions.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular technique for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). In many
real-world scenarios, multiple adapters are loaded simultaneously to enable LLM
customization for personalized user experiences or to support a diverse range
of tasks. Although each adapter is lightweight in isolation, their aggregate
cost becomes substantial at scale. To address this, we propose LoRAQuant, a
mixed-precision post-training quantization method tailored to LoRA.
Specifically, LoRAQuant reparameterizes each adapter by singular value
decomposition (SVD) to concentrate the most important information into specific
rows and columns. This makes it possible to quantize the important components
to higher precision, while quantizing the rest to ultra-low bitwidth. We
conduct comprehensive experiments with LLaMA 2-7B, LLaMA 2-13B, and Mistral 7B
models on mathematical reasoning, coding, and summarization tasks. Results show
that our LoRAQuant uses significantly lower bits than other quantization
methods, but achieves comparable or even higher performance.

Abstract: Communication remains a central bottleneck in large-scale distributed machine
learning, and gradient sparsification has emerged as a promising strategy to
alleviate this challenge. However, existing gradient compressors face notable
limitations: Rand-$K$\ discards structural information and performs poorly in
practice, while Top-$K$\ preserves informative entries but loses the
contraction property and requires costly All-Gather operations. In this paper,
we propose ARC-Top-$K$, an {All-Reduce}-Compatible Top-$K$ compressor that
aligns sparsity patterns across nodes using a lightweight sketch of the
gradient, enabling index-free All-Reduce while preserving globally significant
information. ARC-Top-$K$\ is provably contractive and, when combined with
momentum error feedback (EF21M), achieves linear speedup and sharper
convergence rates than the original EF21M under standard assumptions.
Empirically, ARC-Top-$K$\ matches the accuracy of Top-$K$\ while reducing
wall-clock training time by up to 60.7\%, offering an efficient and scalable
solution that combines the robustness of Rand-$K$\ with the strong performance
of Top-$K$.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of certain data points
from a trained model without costly retraining. Most practical MU algorithms
are only approximate and their performance can only be assessed empirically.
Care must therefore be taken to make empirical comparisons as representative as
possible. A common practice is to run the MU algorithm multiple times
independently starting from the same trained model. In this work, we
demonstrate that this practice can give highly non-representative results
because -- even for the same architecture and same dataset -- some MU methods
can be highly sensitive to the choice of random number seed used for model
training. We therefore recommend that empirical
comphttps://info.arxiv.org/help/prep#commentsarisons of MU algorithms should
also reflect the variability across different model training seeds.

Abstract: We present a simple perturbation mechanism for the release of $d$-dimensional
covariance matrices $\Sigma$ under pure differential privacy. For large
datasets with at least $n\geq d^2/\varepsilon$ elements, our mechanism recovers
the provably optimal Frobenius norm error guarantees of
\cite{nikolov2023private}, while simultaneously achieving best known error for
all other $p$-Schatten norms, with $p\in [1,\infty]$. Our error is
information-theoretically optimal for all $p\ge 2$, in particular, our
mechanism is the first purely private covariance estimator that achieves
optimal error in spectral norm.
  For small datasets $n< d^2/\varepsilon$, we further show that by projecting
the output onto the nuclear norm ball of appropriate radius, our algorithm
achieves the optimal Frobenius norm error $O(\sqrt{d\;\text{Tr}(\Sigma) /n})$,
improving over the known bounds of $O(\sqrt{d/n})$ of \cite{nikolov2023private}
and ${O}\big(d^{3/4}\sqrt{\text{Tr}(\Sigma)/n}\big)$ of
\cite{dong2022differentially}.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a
scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless
multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing
OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming
\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or
forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous}
wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device
and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL
largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly
non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless
heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,
time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We
derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient
norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this
trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an
efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only
statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image
classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates
convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL
baselines.

Abstract: Quantization is the key method for reducing inference latency, power and
memory footprint of generative AI models. However, accuracy often degrades
sharply when activations are quantized below eight bits. Recent work suggests
that invertible linear transformations (e.g. rotations) can aid quantization,
by reparameterizing feature channels and weights. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Sequence Transformation and Mixed Precision} (STaMP) quantization, a
novel strategy that applies linear transformations along the \textit{sequence}
dimension to exploit the strong local correlation in language and visual data.
By keeping a small number of tokens in each intermediate activation at higher
precision, we can maintain model accuracy at lower (average) activations
bit-widths. We evaluate STaMP on recent LVM and LLM architectures,
demonstrating that it significantly improves low bit width activation
quantization and complements established activation and weight quantization
methods including recent feature transformations.

Abstract: How can we explain the influence of training data on black-box models?
Influence functions (IFs) offer a post-hoc solution by utilizing gradients and
Hessians. However, computing the Hessian for an entire dataset is
resource-intensive, necessitating a feasible alternative. A common approach
involves randomly sampling a small subset of the training data, but this method
often results in highly inconsistent IF estimates due to the high variance in
sample configurations. To address this, we propose two advanced sampling
techniques based on features and logits. These samplers select a small yet
representative subset of the entire dataset by considering the stochastic
distribution of features or logits, thereby enhancing the accuracy of IF
estimations. We validate our approach through class removal experiments, a
typical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively the
model forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the
remaining classes. Our method reduces computation time by 30.1% and memory
usage by 42.2%, or improves the F1-score by 2.5% compared to the baseline.

Abstract: Recent research on time series foundation models has primarily focused on
forecasting, leaving it unclear how generalizable their learned representations
are. In this study, we examine whether frozen pre-trained forecasting models
can provide effective representations for classification. To this end, we
compare different representation extraction strategies and introduce two
model-agnostic embedding augmentations. Our experiments show that the best
forecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or even
surpasses that of state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for
classification. Moreover, we observe a positive correlation between forecasting
and classification performance. These findings challenge the assumption that
task-specific pre-training is necessary, and suggest that learning to forecast
may provide a powerful route toward constructing general-purpose time series
foundation models.

Abstract: We study the ability of Transformer models to learn sequences generated by
Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a widely used family of pseudo-random
number generators (PRNGs). PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty
over linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise
shifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that
Transformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on
unseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published
classical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up
to $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens.
Surprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can
be reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented
together during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying
structures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with
modulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for
near-perfect prediction grows as $\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization
enters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \geq
2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating
a critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding
layers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneously
groups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters,
revealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.

Abstract: This work introduces a parametric simulation-free reduced order model for
incompressible flows undergoing a Hopf bifurcation, leveraging the
parametrisation method for invariant manifolds. Unlike data-driven approaches,
this method operates directly on the governing equations, eliminating the need
for full-order simulations. The proposed model is computed at a single value of
the bifurcation parameter yet remains valid over a range of values. The
approach systematically constructs an invariant manifold and embedded dynamics,
providing an accurate and efficient reduction of the original system. The
ability to capture pre-critical steady states, the bifurcation point, and
post-critical limit cycle oscillations is demonstrated by a strong agreement
between the reduced order model and full order simulations, while achieving
significant computational speed-up.

Abstract: A domain decomposition method for the solution of general
variable-coefficient elliptic partial differential equations on regular domains
is introduced. The method is based on tessellating the domain into overlapping
thin slabs or shells, and then explicitly forming a reduced linear system that
connects the different domains. Rank-structure ('H-matrix structure') is
exploited to handle the large dense blocks that arise in the reduced linear
system. Importantly, the formulation used is well-conditioned, as it converges
to a second kind Fredholm equation as the precision in the local solves is
refined. Moreover, the dense blocks that arise are far more data-sparse than in
existing formulations, leading to faster and more efficient H-matrix
arithmetic. To form the reduced linear system, black-box randomized compression
is used, taking full advantage of the fact that sparse direct solvers are
highly efficient on the thin sub-domains. Numerical experiments demonstrate
that our solver can handle oscillatory 2D and 3D problems with as many as 28
million degrees of freedom.

Abstract: We present a multi-dimensional, arbitrary-order hybrid reconstruction
framework for compressible flows on unstructured meshes. The method advances
high-resolution schemes by combining the efficiency of linear reconstruction
with the robustness of nonlinear formulations, activated only when needed
through a novel a priori detection strategy. This minimizes the use of costly
Compact Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (CWENOZ) or Monotonic
Upstream-centered Scheme for Conservation Laws (MUSCL) reconstructions,
reducing computational cost without compromising accuracy or stability. The
framework merges CWENOZ and the Multi-dimensional Optimal Order Detection
(MOOD) paradigm while introducing a redesigned Numerical Admissibility Detector
(NAD) that classifies the local flow into smooth, weakly non-smooth, and
discontinuous regions in a single step. Each region is then reconstructed using
an optimal method: a high-order linear scheme in smooth areas, CWENOZ in weakly
non-smooth zones, and a second-order MUSCL near discontinuities. This targeted
a priori allocation preserves high-order accuracy where possible and ensures
stable, non-oscillatory behavior near shocks and steep gradients. Implemented
within the open-source unstructured finite-volume solver UCNS3D, the framework
supports arbitrary-order reconstructions on mixed-element meshes. Extensive
two- and three-dimensional benchmarks confirm that it retains the designed
accuracy in smooth regions while greatly improving robustness in
shock-dominated flows. Thanks to the reduced frequency of nonlinear
reconstructions, the method achieves up to 2.5x speed-up over a CWENOZ scheme
of equal order in 3D compressible turbulence. This hybrid approach thus brings
high-order accuracy closer to industrial-scale CFD through its balance of
efficiency, robustness, and reliability.

Abstract: This study presents a meshfree two-dimensional fractional-order Element-Free
Galerkin (2D f-EFG) method as a viable alternative to conventional mesh-based
FEM for a numerical solution of (spatial) fractional-order differential
equations (FDEs). The previously developed one-dimensional f-EFG solver offers
a limited demonstration of the true efficacy of EFG formulations for FDEs, as
it is restricted to simple 1D line geometries. In contrast, the 2D f-EFG solver
proposed and developed here effectively demonstrates the potential of meshfree
approaches for solving FDEs. The proposed solver can handle complex and
irregular 2D domains that are challenging for mesh-based methods. As an
example, the developed framework is employed to investigate nonlocal elasticity
governed by fractional-order constitutive relations in a square and circular
plate. Furthermore, the proposed approach mitigates key drawbacks of FEM,
including high computational cost, mesh generation, and reduced accuracy in
irregular domains. The 2D f-EFG employs 2D Moving Least Squares (MLS)
approximants, which are particularly effective in approximating fractional
derivatives from nodal values. The 2D f-EFG solver is employed here for the
numerical solution of fractional-order linear and nonlinear partial
differential equations corresponding to the nonlocal elastic response of a
plate. The solver developed here is validated with the benchmark results
available in the literature. While the example chosen here focuses on nonlocal
elasticity, the numerical method can be extended for diverse applications of
fractional-order derivatives in multiscale modeling, multiphysics coupling,
anomalous diffusion, and complex material behavior.

Abstract: This paper is dedicated to enhancing the computational efficiency of
traditional parallel-in-time methods for solving stochastic initial-value
problems. The standard parareal algorithm often suffers from slow convergence
when applied to problems with stochastic inputs, primarily due to the poor
quality of the initial guess. To address this issue, we propose a hybrid
parallel algorithm, termed KLE-CGC, which integrates the Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve
(KL) expansion with the coarse grid correction (CGC). The method first employs
the KL expansion to achieve a low-dimensional parameterization of
high-dimensional stochastic parameter fields. Subsequently, a generalized
Polynomial Chaos (gPC) spectral surrogate model is constructed to enable rapid
prediction of the solution field. Utilizing this prediction as the initial
value significantly improves the initial accuracy for the parareal iterations.
A rigorous convergence analysis is provided, establishing that the proposed
framework retains the same theoretical convergence rate as the standard
parareal algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate that KLE-CGC maintains
the same convergence order as the original algorithm while substantially
reducing the number of iterations and improving parallel scalability.

Abstract: We develop an accelerated algorithm for computing an approximate eigenvalue
decomposition of bistochastic normalized kernel matrices. Our approach
constructs a low rank approximation of the original kernel matrix by the
pivoted partial Cholesky algorithm and uses it to compute an approximate
decomposition of its bistochastic normalization without requiring the formation
of the full kernel matrix. The cost of the proposed algorithm depends linearly
on the size of the employed training dataset and quadratically on the rank of
the low rank approximation, offering a significant cost reduction compared to
the naive approach. We apply the proposed algorithm to the kernel based
extraction of spatiotemporal patterns from chaotic dynamics, demonstrating its
accuracy while also comparing it with an alternative algorithm consisting of
subsampling and Nystroem extension.

Abstract: To address the magnetization dynamics in ferromagnetic materials described by
the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation under large damping parameters, a
third-order accurate numerical scheme is developed by building upon a
second-order method \cite{CaiChenWangXie2022} and leveraging its efficiency.
This method boasts two key advantages: first, it only involves solving linear
systems with constant coefficients, enabling the use of fast solvers and thus
significantly enhancing numerical efficiency over existing first or
second-order approaches. Second, it achieves third-order temporal accuracy and
fourth-order spatial accuracy, while being unconditionally stable for large
damping parameters. Numerical tests in 1D and 3D scenarios confirm both its
third-order accuracy and efficiency gains. When large damping parameters are
present, the method demonstrates unconditional stability and reproduces
physically plausible structures. For domain wall dynamics simulations, it
captures the linear relationship between wall velocity and both the damping
parameter and external magnetic field, outperforming lower-order methods in
this regard.

Abstract: This paper deals with the numerical simulation of the 2D magnetic
time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equations in the regime of small but
finite (inverse) Ginzburg-Landau parameter $\epsilon$ and constant (order $1$
in $\epsilon$) applied magnetic field. In this regime, a well-known feature of
the TDGL equation is the appearance of quantized vortices with core size of
order $\epsilon$. Moreover, in the singular limit $\epsilon \searrow 0$, these
vortices evolve according to an explicit ODE system. In this work, we first
introduce a new numerical method for the numerical integration of this limiting
ODE system, which requires to solve a linear second order PDE at each time
step. We also provide a rigorous theoretical justification for this method that
applies to a general class of 2D domains. We then develop and analyze a
numerical strategy based on the finite-dimensional ODE system to efficiently
simulate the infinite-dimensional TDGL equations in the presence of a constant
external magnetic field and for small, but finite, $\epsilon$. This method
allows us to avoid resolving the $\epsilon$-scale when solving the TDGL
equations, where small values of $\epsilon$ typically require very fine meshes
and time steps. We provide numerical examples on a few test cases and justify
the accuracy of the method with numerical investigations.

Abstract: In this paper, local H\"older regularization is incorporated into a
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) framework for solving elliptic partial
differential equations (PDEs). Motivated by the interior regularity properties
of linear elliptic PDEs, a modified loss function is constructed by introducing
local H\"older regularization term. To approximate this term effectively, a
variable-distance discrete sampling strategy is developed. Error estimates are
established to assess the generalization performance of the proposed method.
Numerical experiments on a range of elliptic problems demonstrate notable
improvements in both prediction accuracy and robustness compared to standard
physics-informed neural networks.

Abstract: We consider the minimization of integral functionals in one dimension and
their approximation by $r$-adaptive finite elements. Including the grid of the
FEM approximation as a variable in the minimization, we are able to show that
the optimal grid configurations have a well-defined limit when the number of
nodes in the grid is being sent to infinity. This is done by showing that the
suitably renormalized energy functionals possess a limit in the sense of
$\Gamma$-convergence. We provide numerical examples showing the closeness of
the optimal asymptotic mesh obtained as a minimizer of the $\Gamma$-limit to
the optimal finite meshes.

Abstract: It is well known that phase formation by electrodeposition yields films of
poorly controllable morphology. This typically leads to a range of
technological issues in many fields of electrochemical technology. Presently, a
particularly relevant case is that of high-energy density next-generation
batteries with metal anodes, that cannot yet reach practical cyclability
targets, owing to uncontrolled elelctrode shape evolution. In this scenario,
mathematical modelling is a key tool to lay the knowledge-base for
materials-science advancements liable to lead to concretely stable battery
material architectures. In this work, we introduce the Evolving Surface DIB
(ESDIB) model, a reaction-diffusion system posed on a dynamically evolving
electrode surface. Unlike previous fixed-surface formulations, the ESDIB model
couples surface evolution to the local concentration of electrochemical
species, allowing the geometry of the electrode itself to adapt in response to
deposition. To handle the challenges related to the coupling between surface
motion and species transport, we numerically solve the system by proposing an
extension of the Lumped Evolving Surface Finite Element Method (LESFEM) for
spatial discretisation, combined with an IMEX Euler scheme for time
integration. The model is validated through six numerical experiments, each
compared with laboratory images of electrodeposition. Results demonstrate that
the ESDIB framework accurately captures branching and dendritic growth,
providing a predictive and physically consistent tool for studying metal
deposition phenomena in energy storage devices.

Abstract: Coarse spaces are essential to ensure robustness w.r.t. the number of
subdomains in two-level overlapping Schwarz methods. Robustness with respect to
the coefficients of the underlying partial differential equation (PDE) can be
achieved by adaptive (or spectral) coarse spaces involving the solution of
local eigenproblems. The solution of these eigenproblems, although scalable,
entails a large setup cost which may exceed the cost for the iteration phase.
In this paper we present and analyse a new variant of the GenEO (Generalised
Eigenproblems in the Overlap) coarse space which involves solving eigenproblems
only in a strip connected to the boundary of the subdomain. This leads to a
significant reduction of the setup cost while the method satisfies a similar
coefficient-robust condition number estimate as the original method, albeit
with a possibly larger coarse space.

Abstract: We propose and justify a new approach for fast calculation of the
electrostatic interaction energy of clusters of charged particles in
constrained energy minimization in the framework of rigid protein-ligand
docking. Our ``blind search'' docking technique is based on the low-rank
range-separated (RS) tensor-based representation of the free-space
electrostatic potential of the biomolecule represented on large $n\times
n\times n$ 3D grid. We show that both the collective electrostatic potential of
a complex protein-ligand system and the respective electrostatic interaction
energy can be calculated by tensor techniques in $O(n)$-complexity, such that
the numerical cost for energy calculation only mildly (logarithmically) depends
on the number of particles in the system. Moreover, tensor representation of
the electrostatic potential enables usage of large 3D Cartesian grids (of the
order of $n^3 \sim 10^{12}$), which could allow the accurate modeling of
complexes with several large proteins. In our approach selection of the correct
geometric pose predictions in the localized posing process is based on the
control of van der Waals distance between the target molecular clusters. Here,
we confine ourselves by constrained minimization of the energy functional by
using only fast tensor-based free-space electrostatic energy recalculation for
various rotations and translations of both clusters. Numerical tests of the
electrostatic energy-based ``protein-ligand docking'' algorithm applied to
synthetic and realistic input data present a proof of concept for rather
complex particle configurations. The method may be used in the framework of the
traditional stochastic or deterministic posing/docking techniques.
